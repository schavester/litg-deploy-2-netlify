<h3 class="entry-header">The Cable Report 07/05/05 (TV That Scared the Crap Out of Me)</h3>
<div class="entry-content">
<div class="entry-body">
<strong>In tribute to TV Landâ€™s â€œGreatest Made-For-TV Movies Of All Timeâ€Â&#157; campaign (this week, and next, I believe), Iâ€™m firing up a Cable Report. </strong>
<p><strong><em><u>The Day After</u></em></strong><br>The preceding parental advisories were more than warranted. Iâ€™ve begun to mentally compile a list of grocery store freak out scenes, and <em>The Day After</em> has a spendid one. Watching this again, I was knocked back by the unrelenting bleakness, the degree of bickering insanity amongst the characters, and the special FX are not too shabby &#8211; look for the signature explosion scenes in which victims are x-rayed as if part of a cartoon. Additionally, who can argue with ANY Jason Robards appearance.</p>
<p><strong><em><u>V.</u></em></strong><br>This mini-series did nothing if it didnâ€™t convince me that my parents were face-peeling aliens. The scare lasted weeks, and was eventually replaced by the belief that my Mom was trying to abandon me in the middle of Sears.</p>
<p><strong><em><u>Salemâ€™s Lot</u></em></strong><br>Iâ€™d venture a guess that some of you didnâ€™t even know! It sucks so bad <em>now</em>, because it was a TV movie <em>then. </em>Not to discredit TV movies as a whole, but you wanted scary and gory, and this is neither. To note: <em>Salemâ€™s Lot</em> did prominently feature Geoffrey Lewis, father of Juliette, and the ultimate on-screen sidekick. Speaking of character actors, and as such, getting completely off track here, who knows the name Michael G. Hagerty? Letâ€™s end with a nod to Michael G. Hagerty:</p>
<p>For years, I was hell bent on the misconception that Michael G. Hagerty was John Candyâ€™s brother. The pop-culturally semi-literate will know him as the Mike Duffy in the â€œAAMCOâ€Â&#157; episode of <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em>. His bio on IMDB.com reads as follows:</p>
<p>â€œGraduated from the University of Illinois. He worked at Chicagoâ€™s Second City. He now lives in Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="biopar">Often plays vendors or merchants.â€Â&#157;</p>

<h3 class="entry-header">The Toughest Movies Ever Made</h3>
<div class="entry-content">
<div class="entry-body">
<span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">Prime Cut (1972)</span></span>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">Simple. Gene Hackman runs hookers out of a meatpacking plant and Lee Marvin (in a suit) chases him through a field with a machine gun. Not only is this the toughest movie ever made, that was the toughest sentence ever written.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">ÂÂ </p>
<p>ÂÂ </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><strong><em>Death Hunt (1981)</em></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">Again, this is very simple. Charles Bronson, Lee Marvin, Carl Weathers, and Ed Lauter run around in the middle of a Canadian nowhere and a lot of blood flows. A lot of bloodâ€¦in a Peckinpah way. A man gets his arm caught in a bear trap, and in lieu of getting morphine or any sort of treatment, he gets PUNCHED OUT. Lee Marvin repeatedly kicks the dead body of a comrade, yelling, â€œYou dumb son of a bitch!!!â€Â&#157;</p>
<p><strong><em><br>The French Connection (1971) </em></strong><strong><em>ÂÂ </em></strong></p>
<p>ÂÂ </p>
<p>Thereâ€™s really only one scene in <em>The French Connection</em>: When Popeye Doyle (a 41-year-old Gene Hackman) leaves a bar at dawn, trashed, and manages to pick up a beautiful girl riding her bike around his crappy neighborhood. This scene is toughâ€¦tough to believe.<br>ÂÂ </p>
<p><strong><em>Love Liza (2002) </em></strong><strong><em>ÂÂ </em></strong></p>
<p>ÂÂ </p>
<p>Tough. Tough to sit through.<br>ÂÂ </p>
<p><strong><em>CannonballÂÂ  (1976) </em></strong><strong><em>ÂÂ </em></strong></p>
<p>ÂÂ </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">Paul Bartelâ€™s unfunny account of the elicit coast-to-coast race was the first movie that disturbed me with violence. A good example of how PG-rated violence in the 70â€™s would be R-rated violence today. Cars crush people, and they bleed from the mouth. Drivers are head-shot by snipers, and it contains a Carradine.</p>

<h3 class="entry-header">Capsular Reviews of Anything 1.1</h3>
<div class="entry-content">
<div class="entry-body">
<strong><em>Out of the Blue</em>ÂÂ  (1980)</strong>
<p>Dennis Hopper runs up and down the hallway, waving his hands and screaming. Dennis Hopper sits at the breakfast table, drunk, waving his arms and screaming. Linda Manz, later of <em>Gummo </em>â€œfameâ€Â&#157; (Solomonâ€™s mom), runs away to carouse around with a â€œpunk rockâ€Â&#157; band. Not much fits in-between the (these) lines, here. An entertaining wreck (no pun intended).</p>
<p><strong><em>The Ice Pirates </em>(1984) </strong></p>
<p>This is the eleventh or twelve movie that I remember seeing in the theater. <em>Condorman </em>was the fourth, and <em>The Black Hole </em>was the first. The all-knowing North Pole glowing crystal that creates the universal star rating system is pulling one over on me. This movie got two stars. The climax is loaded with pre-MTV scatter-brained editing tricks. Oddly â€œnameâ€Â&#157; cast with Robert Urich, Anjelica Huston, Ron Pearlman (ok, ok), and a Carradine.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Ballad of the Whiskey Robber </em>(2004â€¦itâ€™s a book)</strong></p>
<p>Best true crime Iâ€™ve read in months, and I read the living shit out of true crime. This past Christmas, I went on a cruise with my mother. When I wasnâ€™t drunk (afternoons at pool and prior to daily nap), I read the 2003 and 2004 editions of <em>The Best American Crime Writing</em> in the space of a week. Totally engaging, easy, and addictive. <em>Scary Monsters and Super Freaks</em> is in the same territory, but more entertainment biz related. Perfect vacation fare. In order to fit in better on the pool deck, I purchased Robin Cookâ€™s <em>Seizure</em> from the duty-free shop, but I couldnâ€™t dance with that thing. The Nashvillian real estate agent sunning next to me was engrossed in Robert B. Parkerâ€™s <em>Stone Cold</em>, but weâ€™re veering into fiction here, with my only point being that THIS BOOK, the story of Attila Ambrus, is a must and erases all other true crimeâ€¦for now.</p>
<p><strong><em>Doâ€™s &#038; Donâ€™ts: 10 Years of Vice Magazineâ€™s Street Fashion Critiques</em></strong></p>
<p>Do your research. There is a picture of a corpse-painted Black Metaller. The caption refers to him as â€œSpeed Metalâ€Â&#157; and goes on to make a tired joke about metalheads huffing glue or suffering from incest down the line or something. Practitioners of speed metal do not wear corpse paint. I felt like I was reading <em>Andy Rooney on Metal</em>, if, of course, that existed.</p>
<p><strong>Every Thin Lizzy album before and including <em>Chinatown</em></strong></p>
<p>â€¦is worth owning. Why, at this late stage in the game, do I have to keep telling people this?</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In 1970, I lived in Sausalito, which is the town that&#8217;s at the other end of the Golden Gate Bridge. Despite what the town is now, back then there were still little enclaves of funk, and my apartment, needless to say, was one of them. It was set on a steep hill, so that although it was technically a basement, there was still a nice view of Richardson Bay, the fishing fleet (yes, there was still a fishing fleet), and Mt. Tamalpais. </p>
<p>One person I&#8217;d always inevitably get to know would be my mailman, because back then I was inundated with free records, and, less frequently, books. The records would come sometimes in outrageous boxes with promo trinkets in them, the books were always heavy, and so there was always a lot of mail at my house. At one point, my mailman was a jolly young guy with wire-framed glasses, who seemed too smart to be in this for a career &#8212; you saw a lot of folks like that working in the Post Office in those days. This one&#8217;s name was Jim, and sometimes he&#8217;d stop to chat for a moment. Nice guy. </p>
<p>But one day he showed up and announced that he was quitting. &#8220;Yup. I&#8217;ve saved up enough money and me and my girlfriend are going to do something we&#8217;ve always wanted to do: go to Africa.&#8221; Now, this was a surprise, especially since Jim was white (and I presumed his girlfriend was, too). There was something of a vogue for middle-class black Americans to visit Africa back then, but you didn&#8217;t get many white tourists from the States. It was also a surprise because I&#8217;d gotten a book in the mail called <em>Bright Continent</em>, by Susan Blumenthal, an American woman who&#8217;d done the same thing and published a guidebook to sub-Saharan Africa. Remember, this was in the days before <em>Lonely Planet</em> and so on &#8212; it was 1974 or so, and books like this just didn&#8217;t exist. I&#8217;d taken a look in it and gotten hooked; it was not only useful as a guide, but it was fun to read. </p>
<p>So I mentioned this to Jim, and he said sure, he&#8217;d love to look at it. &#8220;Take it with you,&#8221; I suggested. &#8220;Bring it back when you get back.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he did. It remains one of my treasures: beat up, bookmarked with odd bus tickets and harissa-can labels, annotated with corrections and amplifications. I&#8217;ve never been to sub-Saharan (or super-Saharan, for that matter) Africa, but I&#8217;ve got a book that has. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what happened next, but I lost track of Jim and eventually moved to Texas. </p>
<p>Fast forward.</p>
<p>Last year, I heard from Jim again. He&#8217;d found this blog, and was bemoaning the fact that he&#8217;d been in Berlin some months earlier, and hadn&#8217;t known I was here. He was in Portland, Oregon now, selling real estate and hoping to find something else to do, but loving Oregon and hoping I could visit. Well, that was sort of out of the question, but it sure was good to hear from him, and yes, it <em>was</em> too bad that he hadn&#8217;t known I was here. But, I said in my e-mail back to him, I had a friend in Eugene, Oregon, who constantly fantasized about moving to Portland but didn&#8217;t seem to be doing anything about it. Not only that, I figured Jim would like this guy and maybe he could kick his butt gently enough so that he&#8217;d move and realize his dream while putting a couple of bucks in Jim&#8217;s pocket. </p>
<p>And that&#8217;s just what happened: Brett and his wife Carole had dinner with Jim one evening when they were in town for some musical event and Jim wound up showing them a place that they wound up buying. Everybody&#8217;s happy: Brett&#8217;s doing a lot more good work and is much happier being out of the decaying hippie/university surroundings he was in, Carole&#8217;s doing fine with her artwork and other innumerable projects, and Jim&#8217;s got a couple of people he likes to hang out with. </p>
<p>I like happy endings, myself, but there&#8217;s more. To thank me for sending him customers, Jim sent me a gift. It&#8217;s a â‚¬200 gift certificate redeemable at the restaurant Quarré or the &#8220;gourmet restaurant&#8221; Lorenz Adlon at the Hotel Adlon. It expires on April 19 and cannot be renewed. </p>
<p>And when I saw it, my heart sank. I knew he meant well, and yet the Adlon pretty much represents a huge hunk of what I don&#8217;t like about this city. It&#8217;s got a horrible reputation as a place to stay: I once helped an editor for <em>Conde Nast Traveller</em> research a story on Berlin, and he was staying there, went for a walk, and was refused re-entry because he wasn&#8217;t wearing a jacket. He finally convinced the doorman to accompany him to the front desk, where they conceded that he was, indeed, a guest. Then there was the young African woman who was fired for wearing her hair in an &#8220;unconventional&#8221; style, albeit one traditional to her people &#8212; and hardly outrageous. The stories go on and on; the high-end travellers I know avoid the place. </p>
<p>The idea that I could get into one of their restaurants without a jacket and tie, too, is ludicrous. That&#8217;s not the way I dresss, nor is it the way you have to dress in most restaurants here. One nice thing about Berlin is that, outside of government circles, anyway, it&#8217;s very informal. I don&#8217;t want to eat where the Bonners eat anyway, so they can have their jackets and ties. </p>
<p>Jim was, understandably, distressed that I was upset by this gift. Why, he said, he&#8217;d been to the Adlon and it didn&#8217;t seem like that kind of place. And couldn&#8217;t I borrow a jacket and tie? (Answer: no. From whom? Nobody I know has one either!)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried not thinking about this for a while, but it occurred to me recently that the clock was ticking on this gift, so I took it down the other day and saw the date. I honestly don&#8217;t know what to do. I don&#8217;t think they check ID when you cash it in, so maybe I should sell it. But I don&#8217;t know anyone who&#8217;d want to buy it, either. Should I hit <a href="https://berlin.craigslist.org/">Craigslist?</a> Just let it expire quietly in its folder here by my desk? It&#8217;s only eight days away. </p>
<p>Some day, I hope, I&#8217;ll visit Portland. I also hope I&#8217;ll have enough money to take Jim out to dinner and explain the cultural nuance behind all of this. Meanwhile, I&#8217;ve got a white elephant with a Quadriga on it making me feel guilty.</p>

<strong><span style="color:#3333ff;">The Casuals â€“The Witch/ Good Times â€“Dawn DNS.1069 (1974 UK)</span></strong>
<p><span style="color:#66ffff;">Very late single by <strong>The Casuals</strong> who I believe by this time bore no relation to the <strong>Jesamine </strong>line-up. The group was probably <strong>Chris Evans</strong> and <strong>Rob Moore</strong> AKA <strong>Kansas Hook</strong>/ <strong>American Jam Band</strong>. <strong>The Witch</strong> is an OK 70s Hard Rocker spoiled by the vocal histrionics â€“weâ€™re nearly in <strong>Judas Priest</strong> territory here and a long way from the Casualsâ€™ 60s bouffant hair pop. The B Side is a surprisingly fiery work out of the <strong>Easybeats </strong>tune. They omit the main riff, add an incongruous keyboard part and muddle up the lyrics, but they certainly make it their own!<br></span><br><span style="color:#ff0000;">Click on title for edits of <strong>Good Times</strong> and <strong>The Witch</strong></span></p>

<p>I shaved off my moustache this morning, and now I have a clean-shaven upper lip for the first time in 13-14 years.  I first grew a moustache two years earlier to that, and the last time I was &#8216;stasheless lasted one week.  It was odd to see my face in the mirror, all moony and sometimes reflecting back at me what appeared to be a bad photocopy of my teenage face.  I&#8217;m thinking muttonchops are next.</p>

She went to every show I did â€“ and at that time we were averaging 2-3 per week â€“ and when she told me she was starting a record label, I thought that was pretty cool. She stumped me with her first artist, though, telling me it was something by <a href="https://agonyshorthand.blogspot.com/2003/03/bill-direen-and-bilders-builders-its.html">BILL DIREEN &#038; THE BILDERS</a>, and then getting a little annoyed when I didnâ€™t know who that was. She was all, <em>â€œYou donâ€™t know who that is?â€Â&#157;</em>, and I was all, <em>â€œNoâ€Â&#157;</em>. So she goes, <em>â€œHeâ€™s a New Zealand outsider pop legendâ€Â&#157;</em>, and then I go, <em>â€œOh, well I havenâ€™t heard of himâ€Â&#157;</em>. So sheâ€™s all, <em>â€œlaterâ€Â&#157;</em>. Of course I bought Direen&#8217;s <strong>â€œAlien/Skullsâ€Â&#157;</strong> 45 that came out a few months later on Sharonâ€™s <strong>HECUBA RECORDS,</strong> and became a <a href="https://www.flyingnun.co.nz/archive_site/bands/general/billdireen.html">BILL DIREEN</a> convert shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>His story is arguably the most unsung of the great New Zealand 1980s outsiders (I say arguably because thereâ€™s also<a href="https://agonyshorthand.blogspot.com/2004/06/heroes-of-kiwi-rock-that-even-kiwis_24.html"> THE KIWI ANIMAL</a> and <a href="https://agonyshorthand.blogspot.com/2004/06/heroes-of-kiwi-rock-that-even-kiwis.html">SHOES THIS HIGH</a>, not to mention <a href="https://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=gordons">THE GORDONS</a>), and youâ€™d be well advised to pick up the <strong>FLYING NUN</strong> series of CDs that came out in the mid-90s that collected his early works. Direen still records music to this day and is a published poet of much renown; Hecuba folded up shop very quickly after this single; and I havenâ€™t seen Sharon in a coonâ€™s age (you can still say â€œcoonâ€™s ageâ€Â&#157;, canâ€™t ya?). Iâ€™m posting â€œAlienâ€Â&#157; because itâ€™s my favorite of Direenâ€™s many eerie, organ-heavy loner pop records, which always seem to be uplifting in their way but are full of strange stumbles down dark musical alleys. This particular version is a later (1990?) run-through one of his earliest songs, originally from 1981. Itâ€™s a good one, and you will like it.</p>

<p><strong>What Ever Happened To The Mothers Of Invention?</strong></p>
<p>by Frank Zappa </p>
<p>(<em>Hit Parader</em> no. 48,  April 1970,  pages 23-24)</p>
<p>The Mothers of Invention, the infamous and repulsive rocking teen combo, is not doing concerts any more.  <a href="https://www.jimmycarlblack.com/"><strong>Jimmy Carl Black</strong></a> (the Indian of the group) has formed another ensemble which he calls Geronimo Black (named after his youngest child).  <a href="https://www.united-mutations.com/p/don_preston.htm"><strong>Don (Dom De Wild) Preston</strong></a> is collaborating with avant garde dancer Meredith Monk in performances of electronic music.  <a href="https://www.united-mutations.com/u/ian_underwood.htm"><strong>Ian Robertson Underwood</strong></a> is preparing material for a solo album.  <a href="https://www.united-mutations.com/e/roy_estrada.htm"><strong>Roy Estrada</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.united-mutations.com/g/bunk_gardner.htm"><strong>Bunk Gardner</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.united-mutations.com/g/buzz_gardner.htm"><strong>Buzz Gardner</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.united-mutations.com/t/arthur_tripp.htm"><strong>Art Tripp</strong></a> are doing studio work in Hollywood.  <a href="https://www.united-mutations.com/s/euclid_james_sherwood.htm"><strong>Motorhead (James Euclid) Sherwood</strong></a> is working on his bike and preparing for a featured role in a film <a href="https://www.stevemoore.addr.com/beef.jpeg"><strong>with Captain Beefheart</strong></a>.  Frank Zappa is producing various artists for his record companies, Bizarre and Straight (which he co-owns with Herb Cohen), working on film and television projects and is currently writing arrangements for a new album by French jazz violinist Jean Luc Ponty.  <a href="https://globalia.net/donlope/fz/related/King_Kong.html"><strong>This Ponty album</strong></a>, to be released on World Pacific, will mark the first attempt by any other artist to record a whole album&#39;s worth of Zappa&#39;s writing, exclusive of The Mothers of Invention interpretations.</p>
<p>It is possible that, at a later date, when audiences have properly assimilated the recorded work of the group, a reformation might take place.  The following is a brief summary of The Mothers&#39; first five years of musical experimentation and development.</p>
<p>In 1965 a group was formed called The Mothers.  In 1966 they made <a href="https://lukpac.org/%7Ehandmade/patio/weirdo/images/fomex.jpg"><strong>a record which began a musical revolution</strong></a>.  The Mothers invented Underground Music.  They also invented the double fold rock album and the concept of making a rock album a total piece of music.  The Mothers showed the way to dozens of other groups (including The <a href="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/384528680_c740895a8d.jpg?v=0"><strong>Beatles</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.rocksoff.org/billzappa.jpg"><strong>Stones</strong></a>) with their researches and experimentation in a wide range of musical styles and mediums.</p>
<p>The Mothers set new standards for performance.  In terms of pure musicianship, theatrical presentation, formal concept and sheer absurdity, <a href="https://www.science.uva.nl/~robbert/zappa/files/jpg/Ahead_Of_Their_Time.jpg"><strong>this one ugly band</strong></a> demonstrated to the music industry that it was indeed possible to make the performance of electric music a valid artistic expression.</p>
<p>In 1967 (April through August), The Garrick Theater on Bleecker Street in New York was devastated by cherry bombs, mouldering vegetables, whipped cream, stuffed giraffes and depraved plastic frogs&#8230; the whole range of expressive Americana&#8230; all of it neatly organized into what people today would probably call a &quot;Love Rock Long-Hair Tribal Musical.&quot;  The Mothers called it  â€œPigs And Repugnant: Absolutely Free&quot; (<a href="https://www.detlev-mahnert.de/mothers+zappa.jpg"><strong>an off-Broadway musical</strong></a>)&#8230; it was in its third month when &quot;Hair&quot; first opened.</p>
<p>The Mothers was the first big electric band.  They pioneered the use of amplified and/or electronically modified woodwind instruments&#8230; everything from piccolo to bassoon.  They were the first to use the wah wah pedal on guitar as well as horns and electric keyboard instruments.  They laid some of the theoretical groundwork which influenced the design of many commercially manufactured electro-musical devices.</p>
<p>The Mothers managed to perform in alien time signatures and bizarre harmonic climates with a subtle ease that led many to believe it was all happening in 4/4 with a teen-age back beat.  Through their use of procedures normally associated with contemporary &quot;serious music&quot; (unusual percussion techniques, electronic music, the use of sound in blocks, strands, sheets and vapors), The Mothers were able to direct the attention of a large number of young people to the work of many contemporary composers.</p>
<p>In 1968, Ruben Sano lifted his immense white-gloved hand, made his fingers go &quot;snat!&quot; and instantly Neo-Greaser Rock was born.  A single was released from Ruben&#39;s boss album (remember <em>Cruising with Ruben &amp; the Jets</em> ?) called &quot;Deseri.&quot;  <a href="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2154/2181550229_bb69ec1b53.jpg?v=0"><strong>It was played on many AM stations </strong></a>(actually rising to #39 on the Top Forty at KIOA in Des Moines, Iowa) until programmers discovered Ruben &amp; the Jets was really <a href="https://www.science.uva.nl/~robbert/zappa/files/jpg/ruben.jpg"><strong>The Mothers under a disguise</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the so called <a href="https://www.science.uva.nl/~robbert/zappa/files/jpg/Kill_Ugly_Radio.jpg"><strong>Underground FM stations</strong></a> could boast (because they were so cool and far out) that they actually went so far as to play The Mothers of Invention albums on their stations.  Yes.  Boldly they&#39;d whip a few cuts from <em>Freak Out</em> on their listeners between the steady stream of important blues numbers.</p>
<p>And then of course, there was <a href="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/19/94269947_856eec64fc.jpg?v=0"><strong><em>Uncle Meat</em></strong></a>, recorded back to back with <em>Ruben &amp; the Jets</em> (a somewhat unusual production procedure).  In spite of the musical merit of the album, the only thing that drew any attention was the fact that several words, in common usage, were included in <a href="https://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/dss_files/livinca.htm"><strong>candid dialogue sections</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Awaiting release is <a href="https://wiki.killuglyradio.com/index.php/The_History_And_Collected_Improvisations_Of_The_Mothers_Of_Invention"><strong>a collection of 12 complete albums</strong></a> of Mothers&#39; music, a retrospective exhibition of the group&#39;s most interesting work, covering a span from two years prior to the actual formation of the ensemble, through August 1969.  Included in the collection is documentary material from first rehearsals, tracing the development of the group through to its most recent live performances in the U.S. and Europe, some of which have become almost legendary.  To those people who cared at all about The Mothers&#39; musical explorations (and also those who didn&#39;t care &amp; who wish to be merely entertained), this collection will prove of great interest. </p>

		<p>Enjoyable. Fake Danny Trejo trailerâ€¦.sort of funny. Must side with R.Râ€™s first half &#8211; more subtle nods to exploitation nuance (massive plot holes, stunted and meaningless one-liners, lots of shit that doesnâ€™t make sense, etc). Be warned, though, of the flip-side: Thereâ€™s also aÂÂ plenty of ham-fisted, over-referential crap (the fake worn-out film stock). The violence in <em>Planet Terror</em> is cartoonish and everywhereâ€¦.the squeamish among you should not worry. I donâ€™t like realistic gore/torture, yet this one didnâ€™t bother me at all. Laughed out loud at some childish splatter scenes, truth told.</p>
<p>Now, Tarantinoâ€™s half is a different story. Dialogue-heavy, and Iâ€™ve been known to enjoy his dialogue about 50/50, but itâ€™s weaker than usualâ€¦.and boring. Thereâ€™s far less violence, but itâ€™s more effective/disturbing. Thatâ€™s probably just due to my queasiness re: realistic car accident scenes. Car accidents send me up the wall; the thought of them, the sight of real ones, the sound of them, and when they are realistically depicted in film, I tend to shudder. <em>Death Proof</em>ÂÂ packs oneÂÂ that is alternately ridiculous and jarring. The second halfÂÂ (of the second half) is dumb-dumb surprising and fun. The<em> Vanishing Point</em> references could have been cut in half, however.</p>
<p>The intermission trailers:</p>
<p>EliÂÂ Roth, a director thatÂÂ I care nothing about, delivers the best one, especially if, like me, you grew up watching crappy horror on crappy TV sets on crappy Saturday afternoons.</p>
<p>Recommended.ÂÂ Another complaint before I close: Youâ€™d think that the three hours would blow by. Thatâ€™s not entirely true. Most of Tarantinoâ€™sÂÂ yip-yapping scenes drag. And of course, the whole experience is aided if you are a serious movie nerd thatâ€™s padded your life with loads of film-garbage. ÂÂ </p>

		<p>The other day, I made a hasty decision to leave the S-Bahn at the Wedding station due to an expired ticket, and figured that, since it was almost a nice day, I&#8217;d just walk home. Reaching the former East-West border, I was gratified to see that one of my favorite bits of unknown Berlin was still intact. The last time I was around it, the sidewalk was under construction, and I figured that, being unauthorized, this delightful installation was probably long gone. </p>
<p>But no. And since it&#8217;s Easter weekend, I went back to shoot it today. </p>

<p>This little fellow is set in the pavement just beyond this familiar marker:</p>

<p>In fact, that&#8217;s why he&#8217;s there. He and his brothers and sisters decorate a swath of sidewalk where Chausseestr. meets Liesenstr. &#8212; a pretty obscure corner of town occupied by not much:</p>
<p><a href="https://bp1.blogger.com/_KUdtEynfLEM/Rhei9GMIDfI/AAAAAAAAAFA/La_fpuyLsWs/s1600-h/DSCN0476.JPG"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=" data-lazy-src="https://bp1.blogger.com/_KUdtEynfLEM/Rhei9GMIDfI/AAAAAAAAAFA/La_fpuyLsWs/s400/DSCN0476.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5050684677636492786"><noscript><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp1.blogger.com/_KUdtEynfLEM/Rhei9GMIDfI/AAAAAAAAAFA/La_fpuyLsWs/s400/DSCN0476.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5050684677636492786"></noscript></a></p>
<p>This patch of earth was a no-man&#8217;s land. Now, as all Berliners know, and few outside of town do, there were two Walls. There was the big, thick one with the rounded bits stuck on top, and, some dozens of meters away, there was a thinner one with less fortification. Inbetween was no-man&#8217;s land, with a path down its middle. This area was filled with all manner of impediments, with the aim of making an escape over the thin wall, across the bare area, and over the big wall to West Berlin, impossible. As we know, it was pretty effective, and it not only sealed Berliners out, but it sealed the no-man&#8217;s land in. </p>
<p>And that&#8217;s where the rabbits come in. I remember my first visit to Berlin in 1988, and climbing one of those observation towers at the edge of the Tiergarten, from which I could see the area which had once held Potsdamer Platz, the lonely scrap of a once-grand hotel the sole witness to what had stood there before the War. Inbetween, dust, rocks, scraggly shrubs and weeds, and rabbits. Lots of rabbits. </p>

<p>Given that I saw the Wall as a symbol of terror, as a structure which had added immeasurably to world tensions, as a (literally) concrete representation of the Communist Threat back then, it was unnerving to look over it and see&#8230;<em>cute.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yeah,&#8221; said one of the friends who were showing me around, &#8220;they got in there somehow, and since there&#8217;s nothing to threaten them, they, well, they did what rabbits do.&#8221; </p>
<p>The Berlin Wall. And lots of rabbits. Apparently they were everywhere.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that there were no threats, though. There were trip-wires attached to automatic firing devices. Hip hop hip trip, KABOOM. One less bunny.</p>

<p>And what about the guard dogs who patrolled with the guards? They must not have had a lot of fun: if they caught a skinny East German trying to defect, they had to give him to the humans. And since Germans love dogs &#8212; even the brutal youth who were conscripted for guard duty on this extremely unpopular assignment must have loved dogs, being German &#8212; who could begrudge faithful Odin a rabbit now and again? </p>

<p>Mmmmm! Bunny sushi!</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s how the rabbits got in the sidewalk. After discovering them for the first time, I mentioned them to a friend who told me that an artist &#8212; an American woman, as I remember &#8212; had installed them in memory of the rabbits who used to live between the Walls, and who, of course, vanished as soon as the Wall was dismantled. When I first saw them, they were a bright coppery color, but as you can see, they&#8217;ve tarnished. There&#8217;s no signature, no tag, no nothing. Just rabbits. (And just today, this friend said she had no knowledge of the rabbits or the artist, so my information may not be correct, although it&#8217;s what I remember from four or five years ago). I love that this group exists in a place almost nobody has any reason to visit, on the edge of a garbage-strewn lot, on the corner of a street nobody lives on. </p>
<p>Not that Liesenstr. is without interest: maybe nobody lives there, but there are a bunch of graveyards, one of which has a French chapel, a French war memorial for soldiers who died in defense of the &#8220;King of Paris,&#8221; and the gravestone of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Fontane">Theodor Fontane</a>. I once collected some big pieces of Wall in this graveyard, and still have them in storage in Texas.</p>
<p>And, at the end of Liesenstr., where it stops at Gartenstr., there are two rotten railroad bridges and, recently stripped of its protective coating of vegetation, a rather large remnant of the Wall:</p>

<p>And, at night, rabbits. Maybe.</p>

<p>(MC Ren)<br>Falling deep in the drums so many of styles<br>Is one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles<br>Cheating and not beating, the crowd I kept seating<br>But weak muthafuckas biting off and they kept eating<br>Styles that kept them full of bull<br>â€˜Cause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full<br>They got the nerve to cuss<br>Only reason niggaz pick up your record is cause they thought it was us</p>
<p>(Dre)<br>Yo, giving what I gotta give, doing what I gotta do<br>You donâ€™t care for me, so who gives a fuck about you<br>You canâ€™t harm me, alarm me<br>â€˜Cause weâ€™re the generals in this fucking hip-hop army<br>The niggaz wit attitudes if you didnâ€™t know<br>We blow, flow and getting loose slow from the get go, yo<br>Try us and take it<br>Yo, fuck this shit, Yella, kick the break in</p>
<p>(Chorus)<br>Itâ€™s the real thing, you are now real, real niggaz, niggaz</p>
<p>(Ren)<br>You can run but you canâ€™t hide, you know Iâ€™m a findâ€™cha<br>â€˜Cause a nigga like Renâ€™s only 2 steps behindâ€™cha<br>Donâ€™t look back, â€™cause youâ€™re shaking and all scared<br>A nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare<br>So sleep wit the lights on, forget that the micâ€™s on<br>Donâ€™t step on my muthafucking stage without nikeâ€™s on<br>Donâ€™t say itâ€™s psychoand then you just might go<br>Mentally fucked up when I let the right blow</p>
<p>(Dre)<br>All these niggers wit the jibber jabber<br>But couldnâ€™t kill a fly wit a muthafucking sledge hammer<br>Gangstas in black are out there<br>But only because, yo, itâ€™s the shit we wear<br>On my muthafucking dick<br>But Iâ€™m a love it when you drop like a muthafucking brick<br>So, yo, step off, go to bed, â€™cause if youâ€™re mislead<br>You get a muthafucking bullet in your dome head</p>
<p>(Eazy-E)<br>Black, the good, the bad, the ugly, you see<br>A little streetwise nigga, you know me<br>Rolling wit some real niggaz playing for keeps<br>But you muthafuckas know who run the streets<br>Wit that hardcore hip-hop rap shit<br>(Ren)(Now how much harder can another nigga get)<br>Trying to be like us, sound like us, dress like us<br>(Dre)(Ashes to ashes and dust to dust<br>So nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, please<br>Since youâ€™re on the dick why donâ€™t you drop to your knees<br>â€˜Cause Iâ€™m a muthafucka thatâ€™s out to kill<br>Eazy-E, a nigga thatâ€™s real</p>
<p>(Dre) Real niggaz, straight off the streets of Compton<br>Quick to get in your shit without second thought<br>And if your ass get smoked, itâ€™s my bullet you caught<br>So if youâ€™re talking shit about the niggaz in black<br>Bow down to the Kingâ€™s and Raiderâ€™s hats</p>
<p>(Ren)<br>They played out, thatâ€™s what niggaz were chanting<br>One nigga left and they said we ainâ€™t happening<br>People had thought we was finished and then done wit<br>But if you think about it, yo, we really ainâ€™t done shit<br>Yet, so cover your ears and wipe your tears<br>And quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas<br>And when the new record come, Iâ€™ll come like a fucking bomb<br>Asking for fucking money, donâ€™t buy you a fucking crumb<br>Youâ€™re on the dicks of four niggaz not one<br>And when it comes to dicks, you donâ€™t even have one<br>So brace yourself to make sure you donâ€™t get fucked up<br>Because if I let you slide, itâ€™s just â€™cause you lucked up<br>Donâ€™t come in my face again, because Iâ€™m a floor ya<br>And if youâ€™re a bitch, Iâ€™m a fucking ignore ya</p>
<p>Because my attitudes a little bigga<br>â€˜Cause MC Ren is one of the real niggaz</p>
<p>(Dre)<br>Lost in a muthafucking world of madness<br>Sadness, but Dre is just a nigga that gladdest<br>Sucking muthafuckas like you, making wack jams<br>Because it only shows you how dope I am<br>Never try to ignore us<br>When Iâ€™m expressing, stand still like youâ€™re full of rigamortis<br>â€˜Cause Iâ€™m a real nigga, but I guess you figure<br>You can break me, take me, but watch me pull the trigger<br>Dre is just a nigga wit hard, a nigga thatâ€™s smart<br>A nigga thatâ€™s pay to say what others are scared to play<br>We started out wit too much cargo<br>So Iâ€™m glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold<br>Yo, NWA, criticize for what we say<br>But Iâ€™m a do the shit anyway<br>â€˜Cause Iâ€™m the muthafucking doctor,never faking<br>Yo, Yella, kick the muthafucking break in</p>
<p>Chorus</p>
<p>(Ren) NWA , straight ouut muthafucking Compton<br>Taking over shit in all of the 1990â€™s<br>Yo, Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, Eazy-E<br>And I am MC Ren, yo, NWA taking over this muthafucka yâ€™all<br>Lyrics > N.W.A Lyrics > N.W.A Real Niggaz Lyrics<br>Can I get a fuckinâ€™ translator, please?â€Â&#157;<br>ÂÂ </p>

Oh, and itâ€™s one of the great records of the 80s to boot, and an all-time second-wave-of-garage-punk landmark. One <a href="https://agonyshorthand.blogspot.com/2004/11/forgotten-classics-of-1980s-garage.html">critic who shall not be named</a> had this to say: &#8220;&#8230;.<em>Big, loud, stomping basement rock that approximates a runaway boulder hooked up to a set of clanking chains. Their sorta-cover of Beefheart&#8217;s &#8220;Diddy Wah Diddy&#8221; could almost be no-wave inspired, and the frantic chords played on this sound like they&#8217;re shooting sparks. Rob Vasquez was and remains a singular talent who deserves to be handsomely paid for his genius, and lionized &amp; feted the world over&#8230;.â€Â&#157;</em></p>
<p>I could not have said it better myself! I bought mine on a whim because they were from Seattle and had a Sub Pop connection â€“ which in 1988 was a mark of quality, or so I reckoned at the time â€“ and have until now yet to look back. 600 made, released on <strong>REGAL SELECT</strong> records to a handful of record dorks in â€™88, and now ready for you to download and celebrate with your pals all weekend long.</p>
