<p>Attention, Lost Groovers everywhere:</p>
<p>Your assignment today is to gather together in one medium-sized concert facility, for one evening only, one dozen of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most popular entertainers. Age, style, size, corporate affiliation and particularly musical pigeonhole is to be strictly of no concern whatsoever. Each act just has to have had a heck of a lot of their songs downloaded, perhaps maybe even sold, over the past calendar year or so.</p>
<p>Then, with a bare minimum of rehearsal or directorial guidelines of any sort Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and an equally bare-boned budget to boot Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a two-hour concert has to sequenced, scored, choreographed and executed upon a single stage utilizing all these chosen singers, dancers and accompanists, the entire proceedings recorded and videoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d completely live, music <em>and</em> vocals, without re-takes, and the resultant miles of tape then edited, printed, promoted and distributed for public viewing into theatres. </p>
<p>Oh. And this all has to be completed within the period of a mere <em>fourteen days</em>, from show-date to release-date, by the way.</p>
<p>Finished laughing? Of course in a 21st century scheme of things such an endeavor would scarcely get past the imagining stage I agree, quickly dismissed out-of-hand (not to mention out-of-mind) as completely unfeasible; one legal, logistical Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not to mention <em>ego</em>-tistical Ã¢â‚¬â€œ nightmare of gargantuan proportions.  </p>
<p><em>But</em>, in that strange and distant galaxy known as The Sixties, where anything seemed possible, everything was tried at least once, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“noÃ¢â‚¬Â was a word only uttered when speaking to people over thirty, undertakings of such grand socio-musical import were thought no more impractical than, say, making orange juice out of freeze-dried crystals then flying with them all the way to the moon and back. </p>
<p>What <em>is</em> hard to believe, however, is that one such concert event filmed inside the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium on the night of October 29, 1964 in front of a few hundred local high school students should not only survive to be released on DVD, but that its one hundred and twelve monochrome minutes remain as utterly entertaining, and downright engrossing, all these forty-five years later.</p>
<p><em>The TAMI Show: CollectorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Edition</em>, now finally available from our friends over at <a href="http://www.shoutfactory.com/browse/312/the_tami_show.aspx"><strong>Shout! Factory</strong></a> is, you see, simply so, <em>so</em> much more than merely <em>Monterey Pop</em> without the lysergic, <em>Woodstock</em> without the mudslides or, yes, Altamont minus pool cues and homicide victims. True, one <em>could</em> consider this film as Ã¢â‚¬Å“justÃ¢â‚¬Â the single most frantically paced, ultra-high-decibel time capsule of an extraordinary era ever preserved on disc. Or even, as Quentin Tarantino most assuredly claims, Ã¢â‚¬Å“in the top three of all rock movies.Ã¢â‚¬Â </p>
<p>I will go all that one further, however: <em>The TAMI Show</em> (as in <em>Teenage Awards Music International</em>, by the way) is absolutely essential viewing to anyone and everyone who consider themselves fans, followers, and/or students of popular music. </p>
<p>Period.             </p>
<p>Allow me to elaborate. The dozen acts, co-hosts <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2010/03/19/arts/tami.jandean.jpg"><strong>Jan and Dean</strong></a> sing whilst skateboarding across the opening credits, did indeed come Ã¢â‚¬Å“From All Over The World.Ã¢â‚¬Â Not to mention everywhere across the musical map as well: Kicked off by Ã¢â‚¬Å“the guy who started it allÃ¢â‚¬Â as Jan (no relation) Berry announces, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0yGXKoA6Ek"><strong>Chuck Berry</strong></a> duck-walks us all the way from St. Louis to New York City, where the about-to-be- renovated Brill Building sound is sung most proudly and loudly by none other than <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/columnpic/Lesley2.jpg"><strong>Lesley Gore</strong></a> (whose proto-feminist lyrics and attitude herein should have all you brand new Runaways fans repositioning the birth of grrrl-rock once and for all). </p>
<p>The magnificent Motor City is then represented by Smokey Robinson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ pay particular attention to his MiraclesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ dance-steps during <a href="http://www.coffeecoffeeandmorecoffee.com/archives/tami%20show%201.jpg"><strong>Ã¢â‚¬Å“MickeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s MonkeyÃ¢â‚¬Â</strong></a> Ã¢â‚¬â€œ along with superstars-in-waiting <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8_Uh5gjUFE"><strong>Marvin Gaye</strong></a> (who performs two songs soon to be recorded by a waiting-in-the-wings Rolling Stones) and <a href="http://interactive.wxxi.org/files/images/highlights/TAMI.jpg"><strong>The Supremes</strong></a> (poised to leave behind forever their branding as Ã¢â‚¬Å“those no-hit SupremesÃ¢â‚¬Â with an historic string of global million-sellers). Meanwhile, England swings Santa Monica via <a href="http://www.ronellis.co.uk/images/books/Billy%20J%20Kramer%20&amp;%20George%20Harrison.jpg"><strong>Billy J. Kramer</strong></a> with his Dakotas plus <a href="http://www.gerryandthepacemakers.co.uk/Kari1/gerry-in-california.jpg"><strong>Gerry and the Pacemakers</strong></a> (Ã¢â‚¬Â¦four of impresario Brian EpsteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s other clients unfortunately occupied overseas at this point in time, putting finishing touches onto <em>Beatles For Sale </em>it seems). </p>
<p>Why, even what we now know and love as that runt of the musical litter, Garage Rock, is represented by none other than the aptly-named Barbarians and their, I kid you not, one-handed drummist Victor <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_FKxj7S66vU4/SIOmF_wSEfI/AAAAAAAAA5I/MokdT2Eq4Ag/s400/moulty%2B45"><strong>Ã¢â‚¬Å“MoultyÃ¢â‚¬Â</strong></a> Moulton. Plus special note must here be made of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDIBMaCTwFw"><strong>The Beach Boys</strong></a>Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ four-song set, propelled practically through the roof by <em>their</em> drummer Dennis, as this particular footage was removed from most every existing print of <em>The TAMI Show</em> soon after release and has only now been fully reinstated in all its harmony-drenched, sun-kissed, Surf City splendor.     </p>
<p>And <em>then!</em> As impossible to pin down geographically Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not to mention musically or even vocally Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as he remained for the rest of his career comes the one, the only, the hardest- working <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PCQ6dwBnOyA/S6mevNj033I/AAAAAAAAA5M/xvvxAVmynqY/s1600/James+knees.jpg"><strong>James Brown</strong></a>. </p>
<p>Now itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been said before, but IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll just have to say it again (and again and again): His performance in <em>The TAMI Show</em> remains one of the most jaw-dropping, above-kinetic, gut-<em>and</em>-thigh-ripping performances <em>ever</em> executed. EVER. Anytime, any place, by <em>any</em> one. <em>Everything</em> you may have heard about this man and these particular eighteen minutes (e.g., Ã¢â‚¬Å“the single greatest rock Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll performance ever captured on filmÃ¢â‚¬Â: Rick Rubin) is absolutely, one-<em>thousand</em>-per-cent true. Just look at it yourself if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe me Ã¢â‚¬Â¦or everyone else who has ever seen it.</p>
<p>Somehow, those newly-rolling, <em>original</em> Stones Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with Brian Jones and even <a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_8HkLzUmw8AQ/S5XPwJ5s0KI/AAAAAAAAAeU/-NGjzRsMBJk/tami1.jpg"><strong>Bill Wyman</strong></a>Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s vocal mic present Ã¢â‚¬â€œ arose to the task of following Butane James that fateful night, and their performance closed the event, and the film, with a mixture of pure, simply pimply beat Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ soul which wins over even many of the pole-axed teens whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d just survived James BrownÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s set. </p>
<p>Finally, cue the entire cast and assembled dancers (watch closely for <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/__mokxbTmuJM/S7droSqoL4I/AAAAAAAAE9o/hYMmRXOTN6c/s1600/TeriGarrTAMIShow.jpg"><strong>a very young Teri Garr!</strong></a>) back onstage to frug a mighty big storm up around Jagger and Richard(s) and, scarcely two hours after it all began, the curtain drops. </p>
<p>So, just another night of music, mayhem, and undeniable magic out in L.A. during the fall of Ã¢â‚¬â„¢64, right? But what novice <a href="http://media.thestar.topscms.com/images/57/ce/237364f1487e88abb29cbd607a58.jpeg"><strong>director Steve Binder</strong></a> and his crew captured, and what today is immaculately preserved upon <em>The TAMI Show</em> DVD, is busting-full of rich musical (I repeat: James Brown) <em>and</em> cinematic (Diana RossÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ eyes literally filling the screen during Ã¢â‚¬Å“Where Did Our Love GoÃ¢â‚¬Â) moments which have been oft-shot by everyone from Pennebaker to Scorcese since, but never truly duplicated. For what <em>TAMI</em> managed to mount and maintain all those years ago irrefutably remains the highest of bars for concert events, and films thereof, to reach even today. </p>
<p>It may, sorrowfully, have taken nearly half a century to make it into our homes, but this film has not returned anew one single frame, nor scream, too soon.</p>
<p>Trust me: </p>
<p>You have never seen, nor heard, ANYTHING quite like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpYIWThQbYU"><strong>this</strong></a> before&#8230;..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ã¢â‚¬Å“No more Beatles! No more Stones! We just want the Viletones!Ã¢â‚¬Â went the cry of true teen angst Ã¢â‚¬Ëœround my Toronto neighborhood circa the Summer of Hate, 1977. And, memories of my favorite punk-rock combo from <a href="http://www.hamiltonspectator.com/video2/punkbook/"><strong>a misspent youth</strong></a> notwithstanding, I <em>do</em> find myself feeling very much the same these thirty-three-and-a-third revolutions later as <a href="http://musosguide.com/public_html/musos.wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Beatles_Stones.jpg"><strong>big Beatle box sets and Rolling Stone re-issues</strong></a> continue to dominate our collective, sonic rear-view.</p>
<p>Of course I can still thrill to a remastered (<a href="http://www.beatlesagain.com/images/sly_canada.jpg"><strong>mono!</strong></a>) Ã¢â‚¬Å“She Loves YouÃ¢â‚¬Â as much as the next boomer, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rqqaw9iN0Js"><strong>glimpsing Hendrix backstage</strong></a> inside that <em>Get Yer Ya-YaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s</em> anniversary bundle will always raise a grin or two. But surely, <em>surely</em> there must have been <em>something</em> going on during those scant weeks between 1963 and 1969 when Lennon, McCartney, Jagger and/or Richard compositions werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sitting atop the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hit parades.</p>
<p>Surely!</p>
<p>Well, finally, <em>someone</em> Ã¢â‚¬â€œ namely those utterly fab folk over at <a href="http://www.reelinintheyears.com/"><strong>ReelinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ In The Years</strong></a> Ã¢â‚¬â€œ have seen fit to shed light upon some of the <em>other</em> mop-tops whose sounds and styles filled our six-transistors and Sunday evening <a href="http://files.brandflakesforbreakfast.com/uploaded_images/Ed-Sullivan-esquire-798406.jpg"><strong>Ed Sullivan</strong></a> shows. Yes, the first four editions of whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s promised to be an entire <a href="http://www.reelinintheyears.com/images/britishinvasion_3.jpg"><strong><em>British Invasion</em> series</strong></a> of DVDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s are, you bet, here at last, spotlighting Dusty Springfield, HermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hermits, Gerry and the Pacemakers and the Small Faces.</p>
<p>And what audio/visual treats these discs are! Meticulously researched and packaged, expertly restored and annotated and whenever possible hosted by many of the actual participants themselves, the songs and stories flow in never less than quick, LOUD frenzies so perfectly reminiscent of those once-Swinging Sixties themselves.</p>
<p>So, wherever to start then? How about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrIWPjCk8Gw"><strong>Gerry Marsden fondly recalling</strong></a> the very birth of the Liverpool Sound in the kind of detailed Ã¢â‚¬â€œ sometimes most candidly so Ã¢â‚¬â€œ way no <em>Beatles Anthology</em> would ever dare to. Or a self-admittedly Ã¢â‚¬Å“numbÃ¢â‚¬Â <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0_hVwxkSs"><strong>Dusty Springfield </strong></a>deplaning into Australia only to be accused of being Ã¢â‚¬Å“kookyÃ¢â‚¬Â and a spokesperson for Ã¢â‚¬Å“the hippie philosophyÃ¢â‚¬Â? </p>
<p>Elsewhere, not at all coincidentally perhaps, we discover the hitherto-unknown connection between comedian/philosopher Lord BuckleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spiritual Nazz and the Small FacesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ritual Methedrine, plus learn that it was in fact Peter NooneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seemingly innocent rhythm section who schooled <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~steelbeard1/whoholidayinnmoonphoto.jpg"><strong>Keith Moon</strong></a> in the fine art of Holiday Inn Ã¢â‚¬Å“redecoratingÃ¢â‚¬Â: why, watch closely and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll even spot actual Super 8 footage of pool-side, long underwear-festooned Who/Hermits hi-jinks deep within the Bonus Footage!</p>
<p>Such meaty beaty Bacchanalian moments aside however, this is one <em>British Invasion</em> which truly concentrates, as all such documentaries should but seldom do, on the MUSIC. And there are literally <em>hours</em> of vintage performance clips filling these discs, immaculately reproduced and shown complete and uncut, with nary a single word of needless graphic or narration dubbed over the guitar solos for once. Plus, not just the usual stream of oft-recycled <em>Shindig</em> and Sullivan snips either: The producers have obviously gone to incredible lengths to scour the globe in search of seldom, if ever seen footage of, for example, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TJm_Y1Muc"><strong>HermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hermits</strong></a> on Norwegian television or GerryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Pacemakers in LiverpoolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cavern shooting their very own <em>Ferry Cross The Mersey</em> (Ã¢â‚¬Â¦now, when does <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-d0xUXdzoY"><strong>THAT film</strong></a> finally appear on DVD?!!)</p>
<p>Interestingly though, from the wealth of treasures spread across these discs, I was most pleasantly shocked to witness <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9UujJO8Iw"><strong>downright incendiary footage</strong></a> of the Small FacesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Marquee Club debut, March of 1966. While for all the world looking, dressing, and acting like little more than a Cockney Monkees with cooler hair, trapped from the get-go inside these lads was apparently a solid, fighting-tough beat Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ soul combo whose only Caucasian rivals at the time would have been those Young Rascals themselves. Who knew? (and <em>then</em> stay closely tuned for an extensive <em>Colour Me Pop</em> performance of their masterwork <em>OgdenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Nut Gone Flake</em> complete with Ã¢â‚¬Å“HappinessÃ¢â‚¬Â <a href="http://www.knowledgerush.com/wiki_image/a/aa/Unwin-sm.jpg"><strong>Stanley Unwin</strong></a>Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s narration, I kid you not).</p>
<p>Ã¢â‚¬Å“None of us knew how good and how ahead of our time we were,Ã¢â‚¬Â Small Face Kenney Jones admits herein, and that statement could rightfully serve as the modus operandi behind this entire series. Because, you see, <em>The British Invasion</em>, for the very first time ever, delves so very deeply into the hitherto-unexplored Ã¢â‚¬Å“second tierÃ¢â‚¬Â of mid-Sixties U.K. talent, and in doing so paints most vividly an indelible picture of the eraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s myriad musical and social upheavals. And in a way you just wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get from <em>any</em> existing thumbnail study or PBS pledge special, needless to say. </p>
<p><em>Dusty Springfield: Once Upon a Time</em>, <em>HermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hermits: Listen People</em>, <em>Gerry and the Pacemakers: ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gonna Be All Right</em> and <em>Small Faces: All Or Nothing</em> are available separately or, even better, housed together with two and a half full hours of <em>additional</em> Bonus Disc interview and performance footage as a <a href="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R4mWIjyfL.jpg"><strong>five-DVD collectorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s set</strong></a>. Either way you take them, each deserve to be seen and heard repeatedly by any Merseybeating fan <em>or</em> serious student of rock Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll Ã¢â‚¬Â¦or even for someone who just needs to know the correct way to toss a cherry bomb down a Holiday Inn toilet.</p>
<p>ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s <em>all</em> <a href="http://www.reelinintheyears.com/britishinvasion/"><strong>here</strong></a>. </p>

<p>Still in a most list-ful mood, but <em>this</em> round-up certainly wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a very easy one to compile, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have everyone know. The pickinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s were extremely, uh, thin, to say the very least.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been procrastinating for the better part of a year, but I&#39;m finally ready to announce thatÃ‚Â I&#39;m head over heels for Natalie Gordon, the extraordinarily talented singer, songwriter, and guitarist for Sacramento&#39;s Agent Ribbons.Ã‚Â  So groovy and gorgeousÃ‚Â is she that it didn&#39;t take long for her to officially become my local celebrity crush (although the comely lass who works at a nearby Newsbeat is pretty darn worthy as well.)Ã‚Â  Here, take a gander and you&#39;ll see what I mean:</p>
<p>Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  <img loading="lazy" src="http://submergemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/natalie_agent-ribbonsweb.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" /></p>
<p>Yeah, she&#39;s a doll alright, butÃ‚Â you ain&#39;t gonna hear her music just by staring at her. That&#39;s why I&#39;m here to let you know that Agent Ribbons&#39; debut release <em>On Time Travel and Romance</em> has given Sacramento another reason to be proud of its homegrown musicians. It all began when Natalie befriended Lauren Hess in a downtown used record storeÃ‚Â (which happens to be the very same store featured on theÃ‚Â cover of DJ Shadow&#39;s magnum opus <em>Entroducing . . .</em>Ã‚Â  )Ã‚Â  This meeting of minds gave Natalie a renewed interest in her musical ambitions and inspired her to form a band (<span class="hw"><font size="3"><span class="hw"><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana">ÃƒÂ  la </span></span></font></span>Art Brut) with Lauren sitting in on drums. Agent Ribbons has a decidedly retro sound thanks to Natalie&#39;s focus on vaudeville, cabaret,Ã‚Â and blues traditions in her songs, but she still manages to put a contemporary spin on everything she touches. Writing stories about looking for love after death and running off to join the circus, Natalie has a talent for dishing outÃ‚Â the whimsy without ever sounding overly cute.Ã‚Â  And her vocal on &quot;Birds and Bees&quot; is so hypnotically sensuous that it&#39;s become a permanent fixture on my profile on MySpace. Natalie and Lauren welcomed violinist Naomi Cherie into the mix in 2009 and recorded a forthcoming follow-up called <em>Chateau Crone</em>, so it seems they&#39;re all set to prove they&#39;re not just one-trick ponies. Sadly, the ladies haven&#39;t been able to make ends meet in their hometown and will be moving to Austin this year with the hope of greater success. With Natalie&#39;s promise of frequent visits to Sacramento, I wish them all the luck in the world!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span"> The Clientele</span>&#8211;<span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">Bonfires on the Heath</span> The same kind of majestic, lush psychedelia that had our jaws dropping when <span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">Suburban Light</span> came out nine years ago. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span"> The Raveonettes</span>&#8211;<span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">In and Out of Control</span> Ramones songs told as ghost stories.  This record is both throwaway and brilliant; gets better with each listen. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">   Reissues and Compilations </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span"> New Dawn</span>&#8211;<span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a New Dawn</span> Lost classic from 1970 out of the Pacific Northwest.  Pothead lyrics and fuzzed-out guitar. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span"> Emitt Rhodes</span>&#8211;<span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">The Emitt Rhodes Recordings (1969-73)</span> Rhodes is one of the great unheralded songwriters in pop music history; these four albums are gems showcasing sparkling power pop and gentle psychedelia. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span"> The Apples in Stereo</span>&#8211;<span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">#1 Hits Explosion</span> 16 choices tracks from the Apples recorded output up to this point.  Makes you want to do cartwheels while singing along. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span"> Roy Loney &amp; The Phantom Movers</span>&#8211;<span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">A Hundred Miles an Hour 1978-1989</span> The one-time FlaminÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Groovies frontman kept the GrooviesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ greasy, rockinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ spirit alive with the series of records he made after leaving them. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span"> Spirit</span>&#8211;<span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">Fresh From the Time Coast: The Best of 1968-77 </span>One of the most innovative bands on the late Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60s SoCal scene, Randy California and friends continued to make compelling, jazz- and folk-tinged psych into the late Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ70s. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span"> Big Star</span>&#8211;<span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">Keep an Eye on the Sky</span>  A four-CD treasure of recordings done by one of the most influential bands ever.  All the stuff from the three main albums, yes, but also a stunning live show from Ã¢â‚¬â„¢73, a handful of revelatory pre-Big Star sessions, and alternate versions that are actually worth hearing. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span"> Nirvana</span>&#8211;<span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">Live at Reading</span> A great band playing live when at their very peak. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span"> The Paupers</span>&#8211;<span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">Magic People</span> Psychedelic folk rock from Toronto, 1967.  Part Beau Brummels, part Buffalo Springfield, part LovinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Spoonful.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span"> Funkadelic</span>&#8211;<span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">Standing on the Verge</span> (Best Of) Faultess, one-disc best of Funkadelic that covers their full output, 1969-79, early  acid rock to later acid disco. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span"> T. Rex</span>&#8211;<span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">Spaceball  (The American Radio Sessions)</span> T. Rex doing spots on American radio, 1971-2. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">  Best New Album</span>: The Raveonettes-In and Out of Control </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span"> Best Reissue:</span> Emitt Rhodes-The Emitt Rhodes Recordings </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span"> Best Compilation:</span> (Two-Way Tie) Big Star-Keep an Eye on the Sky; Spirit-Fresh From the Time Coast (Best of 1968-77)  </p>
