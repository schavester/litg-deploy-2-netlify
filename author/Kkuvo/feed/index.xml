Or, because by then my ears and mind have finally tuned to the proper channels for the attentive listening this record deserves. Disc 2 is an instrumental bonus disc that is on the same expressive ambient music plane. After being inspired by the voice of Alex Caldiero, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fun to listen to and decide what words it makes me want to say.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px" class="Apple-style-span">Only 6 tracks long, but the simple sonic atmosphere of The Sister has that slow timeless feeling of a journey on a leaky paddleboat through a swamp or an amusement park ride, with a mumbling old man and his sad lilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ granddaughter as your underpaid tour guides. Is this a Funeral March record? I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think so. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll feel bad about the fate of the curious Squid Boy, and be glad to move on to another track until you realize itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about Sssix Foot Albino Penguins! YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll wonder if the Earl On Mars doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really know heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s putting on a show, and then google Alexandra Elsbeth to find out how to bring her flowers! All the songs were written and performed by one guy named Dan who is very good at pulling out the dark somber moods from his guitars and keys. Highly recommended, even if you already are depressed.</span></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">Attention all psychotic teenagers, abusive fathers, and killer clowns:<span>  </span>Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned by a Ã¢â‚¬â„¢72 Datsun. Nothing can stop her. Not even you. The proof is in this comic book. What seems to begin as a predictable Ã¢â‚¬Å“damsel in distressÃ¢â‚¬Â story about a potty-mouthed hottie named Judy Drood looking for a working phone in the abandoned town of ObidiahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Glen, soon turns into a Ã¢â‚¬Å“how toÃ¢â‚¬Â guide for surviving a gangbang in a haunted circus fairground. There is no hero to the rescue there and there doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to be. Fortunately for Judy there is one semi-sane human being in the town, a little girl named Nellie Kelly. They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t become friends, but perhaps the mutual understanding that they both had shitty parents inspires them to want to protect each other in the midst of all the magic bottles, possessed dolls, mad ghosts, stab wounds, split skulls and splattered blood. Is there a moral to the story? DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be mean to girls.</p>
