<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span"> Telekinesis!</span> (self-titled)  Irresistible power pop, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Coast of CarolinaÃ¢â‚¬Â an instant classic.  </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">The Soundcarriers</span>&#8211;<span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">Harmonium</span> Soft and breezy with a little electronica thrown in, something like Stereolab/Broadcast but with a more direct nod to soft psych from the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60s. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span"> Jah Wobble</span>-&quot;Get Carter&quot; (single) Anyone who knows me knows why IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m interested in this.  But, Ted Lewis connections aside, this is an inspired interpretation of a timeless movie theme. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span"> The Flaming Lips</span>&#8211;<span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">Embryonic</span> A mood-driven record where the overall feel is the point, rather than individual songs; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the Lips doing Prog, and they do it in masterly form. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span"> The Clientele</span>&#8211;<span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">Bonfires on the Heath</span> The same kind of majestic, lush psychedelia that had our jaws dropping when <span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">Suburban Light</span> came out nine years ago. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span"> The Raveonettes</span>&#8211;<span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">In and Out of Control</span> Ramones songs told as ghost stories.  This record is both throwaway and brilliant; gets better with each listen. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span"> New Dawn</span>&#8211;<span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a New Dawn</span> Lost classic from 1970 out of the Pacific Northwest.  Pothead lyrics and fuzzed-out guitar. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span"> The Apples in Stereo</span>&#8211;<span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">#1 Hits Explosion</span> 16 choices tracks from the Apples recorded output up to this point.

<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span"> Big Star</span>&#8211;<span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">Keep an Eye on the Sky</span>  A four-CD treasure of recordings done by one of the most influential bands ever.  All the stuff from the three main albums, yes, but also a stunning live show from Ã¢â‚¬â„¢73, a handful of revelatory pre-Big Star sessions, and alternate versions that are actually worth hearing. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span"> Nirvana</span>&#8211;<span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">Live at Reading</span> A great band playing live when at their very peak. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">Anne Briggs-Anne Briggs</span> Stunning first album by British folksinger Briggs, who is like PJ Harvey doing ancient folk ballads</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">The Magnetic Fields-Distortion</span>:  More great songwriting from Stephen Merritt, and I especially like the ones the girl sings </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">The Raveonettes-Lust Lust Lust </span> They borrow liberally from J&amp;M Chain, but then who doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t?  Feedbacking guitar, spooky vibe, overall sexy and mysterious feel </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">Rosie Flores-Rosie Flores</span> Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rockabilly FillyÃ¢â‚¬Â makes her debut in the late Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ80s, one of the best albums of its kind, ever.  When Rosie tells her man Ã¢â‚¬Å“God may forgive you, but I wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t,Ã¢â‚¬Â she means it. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">Rodriguez-Cold Fact</span>  Sixto Rodriguez is like a Hispanic Lou Reed.  Stone-cold lost classic from Ã¢â‚¬â„¢71 here </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">The Grip Weeds- Infinite Soul</span>: <span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">The Best Of</span>  Excellent power pop from New Jersey.  The Kinks meet Cheap Trick meet The Posies </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">Matthew Sweet-Sunshine Lies</span>  Speaking of power pop . . .  many of the tracks just lie there, but on the best few he revisits his Ã¢â‚¬Å“GirlfriendÃ¢â‚¬Â peak </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">Bobbie Gentry-Ode to Billie Joe/Touch Ã¢â‚¬ËœEm With Love 2-for-1</span>  Gentry is an enigmatic character who has not performed or given interviews for ages. This set collects her startling debut with her best album </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">Beach House-Devotion</span>  BaltimoreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s answer to Opal/Mazzy Star improves upon their impressive first album </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">The Searchers-LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Melody</span> The Searchers have never really gotten the credit they deserve for being at the forefront of mid-Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60s jangle, and here, in Ã¢â‚¬â„¢81, they showed they could handle power pop just as masterfully; they covered Big Star years before the rest of the world caught up </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">Dennis Wilson-Pacific Ocean Blue</span>  The truth is that the effort was more than the end product here, as Dennis just really wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a good singer and could never match brother Brian (who can?) in songwriting and arranging; still, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s some movingly moody and evocative stuff here, done by a troubled soul who was on the way down </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">N.E.R.D.-Seeing Sounds</span>  On the first listen I was dancing around the house and raving to friends that it was the record of the year.  On future listens I heard the lyrics more closely and thought, arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t these guys out of junior high yet?  I would love to hear it as all instrumentals. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">Sean OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Hagan-Musical Paintings</span>  Part of a complicated and interesting collaboration the High LlamasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ main main has done with a Belgian visual artist; as music it just sounds like really good High Llamas instrumentals </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">Jorge Ben-Jorge Ben</span> Tropicalista heavy and guitar wizard at his best, in 1969Ã‚Â </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">The Chevelles-Barbarella Girl God (Best Of) </span>The Ramones from Down Under, with a little more pop sensibility </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">Flamin Groovies-This Band is Red Hot: 1969-79</span> The Groovies recorded two of the most memorable tracks in pop/rock history- Ã¢â‚¬Å“Teenage HeadÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shake Some Action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  As this comp. proves, they did a whole lot more, as well.  Swampy, greasy rock and roll with a boogie kick. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">Various-Thank You Friends: The Ardent Records Story</span> Eye-opening 2-CD collection shows that Alex Chilton and Big Star werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the only band doing interesting stuff around Memphis in the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ70Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">Colin Blunstone-Ennismore/Journey</span> DoesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t match up to BlunstoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s post-Zombies masterpiece One Year, but still two solid records that are better than Argent </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">T. Rex-The Best of the BBC Recordings </span>Marc and friends doing their thing on John PeelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and Bob HarrisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s radio shows during their Electric Warrior-era heyday </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">Various Artists-Halloween a Go-Go</span>  I generally loathe holiday-themed compilations, but Little Steven and Wicked Cool did one that includes Roky Erickson, The Stems, HowlinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Wolf, and a Tegan and Sara track that has become a household favorite here on Watts </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">The Notwist-The Devil, You + Me</span>  Boards of Canada if they incorporated more melody into their noises</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">R.E.M.-Murmur (Expanded Edition)</span> The Ã¢â‚¬â„¢83 show on disc 2 finds them in their best form and is a reminder of what all the hoopla was about to begin with </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">Neil Young-Canterbury House 1968</span> Neil doing an intimate show playing acoustic versions of Buffalo Springfield favorites, as well as stuff that would appear on his underrated solo debut, etc. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">Windy &amp; Carl-Songs for the Broken-Hearted </span> Give them credit for sticking to their guns and doing the space rock stuff almost a decade after it became passÃƒÂ©; moody, eerie sounds that can help you let your head go </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">Reuben Wilson and The Cost of Living-Got to Get Your Own</span> B-3 master and jazz hipster Wilson does cool breeze soul </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">The B-52s-Funplex</span>  I have to disagree with all the music writers who have trashed this in print.  I keep cueing up Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hot CornerÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Deviant IngredientÃ¢â‚¬Â when IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had a couple rounds and feel like moving around in the music room.  </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dom Mariani: An Appreciation</p>
<p>Trying to get your head around Dom MarianiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s long and wide-ranging musical career can be both a confusing and an exhilarating adventure.  Every time you get a handle on one of the great bands heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been in, you find that there is another one to learn about.  As you sort though all of this, two things become very clear: (1) Mariani has a deft touch and keen musical instincts, allowing him to approach each of his projects with command (2) You should never expect one Mariani band or project to sound like the one that came before it.</p>
<p>Mariani formed Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s garage revivalists the Stems in Perth, Australia in the early 80s.  The band released a smattering of singles and an album, At First Sight Violets are Blue (1987), that stand up to the best of all the fuzz psych releases circulating the indie markets at that time (think Fleshtones/Telltale Hearts/ Lyres/Chesterfield Kings/Vipers, et al). Their sublime track Ã¢â‚¬Å“SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s FineÃ¢â‚¬Â was included on RhinoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Children of Nuggets, a box set of songs by Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ80Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s bands influenced by Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s psychedelia and garage.  But just as the Stems were promoting their first long player, and as they were enjoying both critical acclaim and success on the Independent charts in Australia and other parts of the world, they broke up.</p>
<p>Ã¢â‚¬Å“I was always into Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s music, but originally maybe just the more well known bands, like the Beatles, Stones, and Kinks,Ã¢â‚¬Â Mariani told me over the phone recently, by way of describing his personal musical evolution leading up to the formation of the Stems.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“But then I discovered the Nuggets double album, and the Electric Prunes Underground record, so I saw there was this other kind of thing from the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s, which was more like garage rock, and I got totally into that.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
<p>Mariani cites pressure from the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s management and the label to relentlessly promote At First Sight, and the resultant exhaustion, as causes of the StemsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ untimely implosion.  Also, he soon had another project cooking. While in the Stems Mariani met Darryl Mather, then with SydneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the Lime Spiders (another Children of Nuggets band) and later with the Orange Humble Band.  The two discovered a mutual affinity for Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s and Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ70Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s radio pop and decided to get together and make music that would sound more like the Raspberries than the Stooges.  The resulting LP, 1990Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Talk About Us, is now widely considered to be a power pop masterpiece. </p>
<p>Ã¢â‚¬Å“My musical background is very much steeped in Top 40 radio from the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s, things like the Monkees and girl groups and all,Ã¢â‚¬Â Dom says when I ask him about the poppy departure the Someolves were from the Stems.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“And even during the Stems, although we had kind of a hard rock sound, we were listening to things like the dBs and the Plimsouls, which were more pop.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
<p>DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Talk About Us was recorded with Mitch Easter at his famed Drive-In studio in Winston-Salem, North Carolina (Easter has continued to mix, and sometimes play on, MarianiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recordings throughout DomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career).  A great meeting of musical minds, an album made at one of the coolest studios in the world at the time, two songwriters with no apparent lack of inspiration . . .  the future held no barriers for The Someloves, right?  Wrong.  Their label, Mushroom, would only agree to a second album if the band committed to tour to promote the first, something Mather Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a studio animal not interested in playing live Ã¢â‚¬â€œ refused to do.</p>
<p>Someone with less fortitude or creative drive might have given up after seeing his first two bands split up just when they seemed to be going on the rise.  But Mariani was only getting started.  After an enforced recording hiatus which was part of the contractual baggage from The Someloves/Mushroom situation, he exploded back onto the scene in glorious fashion a few years later with his new band, DM3.  </p>
<p>To this listenerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ears, DM3 is where Mariani fully hit his stride, combining the adrenaline rush of the Stems with the pop craftsmanship of the Someloves.  DM3s albums One Times Two Times Red Light (1993), Road to Rome (96) and Rippled Soul (98) are power pop gems (the first two are, anyway; Rippled Soul has some stellar songs but doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite match up in overall quality level with the others) with a little garage energy to them, and are where Mariani pulled off tracks that stand comfortably alongside records made by the likes of Dwight Twilley, Big Star, Badfinger, et al.  </p>
<p>Ã¢â‚¬Å“We were trying to make records with a rock &#038; roll edge to them, but also with great melodies,Ã¢â‚¬Â is how Dom sees DM3, a project he clearly put a lot of himself into and feels passionate about.  </p>
<p>Some of DM3s best songs werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t on the three main albums, but can be found on the odds-and-ends collections Garage Sale Vols 1 &#038; 2 (as well as a Mariani retrospective covered below). One of these oddities, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hold On,Ã¢â‚¬Â is something I have listened to at dangerous volume levels no less than eight times in a row on more than one occasion recently Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an absolute dream of a power pop song.  Another Garage Sale track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Just Like Nancy,Ã¢â‚¬Â is both one of the finest moments in DM3s recorded history and their swan song.  This single, with its splendidly catchy chorus, chugging guitar riff, and sly, vaguely naughty lyrics (a Ã¢â‚¬Å“girl in bootsÃ¢â‚¬Â with Ã¢â‚¬Å“the power to overthrow yaÃ¢â‚¬Â), was the last record made by DM3.  </p>
<p>Always looking to explore new terrain, after the demise of DM3 Mariani showed yet another side of his wide musical range. In 2003 he and his new act The Majestic Kelp released an album of instrumental tracks, Underwater Casino.  The sound here is something like a meeting between Dick Dale, Ennio Morricone, and Martin Denny Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a Spaghetti Western on the beach in Hawaii.</p>
<p>Dom: Ã¢â‚¬Å“What started out as just kind of a quick surf guitar record became something more than that. The songs started to take on some additional character, kind of a soundtrack feel. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quite an interesting group and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re exploring a lot of different things you can do with instrumental music.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
<p>I ask Dom if he feels any difficulty in connecting to the audience when the Majestic Kelp perform live, without the benefit of vocal parts like catchy choruses people can latch onto: </p>
<p>Ã¢â‚¬Å“It has been a learning curve for me.  It kind of divides the audience.  Some of the people who have been listening to my bands over the years get into it, just like they would the Stems or DM3.  But other people are kind of standing there saying, Ã¢â‚¬ËœSo when is he going to start singing?Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Some have said, Ã¢â‚¬ËœI think DomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gone off the planet with this one.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ But other people will just dig it for what it is. Ã¢â‚¬Å“</p>
<p>The Majestic Kelp released a second collection of instrumentals, Music to Chase Cars By, in 2006.  Here they continued to explore some of the same musical themes approached on the first record, but also added some horns, one track filled with Byrdsian jangle, and a bit of a tougher guitar sound on the surf tracks.</p>
<p>In 2004 Mariani put out his first solo album, Homespun Blues and Greens.  A much more personal collection of songs than any of his other projects offered, the 11 tracks here sound like they could be open letters to a close friend or lover, saying things that are difficult but necessary to communicate.  The gentle psychedelia on some of the backing tracks cements the sense of contemplative emotion.</p>
<p>Ã¢â‚¬Å“I toyed around with the idea of making a solo album for quite some time, but initially was uncomfortable putting something out with just my name on it.  For a while I thought of calling it a DM3 record, but that didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem right, because there really wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a band there to drive it.  So I thought, instead of coming up with another band name to add to the list, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll just put my name to it.  And the songs are kind of reflective, anyway, so it makes sense for it be labeled as a solo record.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
<p>If all the great music wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t reward enough in itself to Mariani for sticking with things through all the band breakups, he was honored with a career-affirming retrospective put out by Citadel Records in 2005.  Popsided Guitar (Anthology 1984-2004), a 2-CD, 38-track collection compiles highlights of DomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s varied career, including songs by all of the aforementioned acts as well as a few from his solo album, and it also throws in one song each from one-offs Mariani did with bands The Stonefish and The Stoneage Hearts.  There could have been a few more Stems tracks, but really there is little to complain about on the comp. The selections are well chosen and bring to magnificent life a career that has not received its due attention and appreciation.  </p>
<p>One Mariani project not covered in the Popsided Guitar comp. is the reformed Stems.  After having excellent compilations of their stuff put out by both Citadel (Mushroom Soup, 2003) and Get Hip (Terminal Cool, 2005), as well as seeing a 2-CD reissue of the At First Sight record (2003, Warners Australia), the band released a set of newly recorded material in 2007.  Listening to Headsup, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d think The Stems had never gone away.  The 10 tracks further the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legacy as psych garage masters, especially the riff-heavy Ã¢â‚¬Å“LiarÃ¢â‚¬Â and the assured rocker Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hellbound Train.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Listening to this record, you can easily see why Little Steven once invited the Stems to perform at his Underground Garage festival in New York.</p>
<p>So are the Stems fully reformed now, can we expect another release from them sometime sooner than the 20 years which separated their first two LPs?</p>
<p>Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are talking about doing another recording, although IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not sure when that will be.  WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re thinking about doing something like the FlaminÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Groovies JumpinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in the Night record, where itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be some favorite covers alongside some originals.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
<p>And what might some of those covers be?</p>
<p>Ã¢â‚¬Å“Well, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re talking about doing all Australian songs.  Ã¢â‚¬ËœFriday on My MindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ by the Easybeats is one weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re thinking of.  Ã¢â‚¬ËœCome On,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ by the Atlantics. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re also looking at some of the very early Bee Gees stuff, looking for something there that might be appropriate.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
<p>Dom is also at work on a third Majestic Kelp record, one with vocals, including some Beach Boys-style harmonies.  He looks to finish the album by the end of this year and hopes for an early 2009 release.  And while he is taking some down-time now after a recent Stems tour, he seems never too far away from the next gig, whether it be in Australia, Europe, or at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, where the Stems performed this year and where Mariani expects to be again next Spring, either with the Stems or on his own.  Prolific and diverse as he is with his music, no one should be surprised if by that time he has a totally new band trying for a sound and feel different from all his other projects.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Don&#39;t know much about this band yet, and almost don&#39;t want to, just to keep the mystery intact.  Excellent, odd <span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">psychedelia</span> from<span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span"> Mexico</span>.  Got hipped to them via their track, &quot;Changing the Colors of Life,&quot; on the <span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">Nuggets II</span> box set.  Took me a few years after hearing that to follow up and dig deeper, and now that I have I am a better person for it.  Their late 60s album <span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">El Esquimal</span> is cool and weird and mind-bending. The title track is a rollicking, Spanish-language version of <span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">Dylan</span>&#39;s &quot;The Mighty Quinn.&quot;  Another cover, and perhaps the most trippy moment on the record, is their take on <span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">The Zombies</span>&#39;s &quot;I Love You,&quot; read as, of course, &quot;Te Quiero&quot; &#8211; the opening to that track is grand psychedelia and when the melody kicks in it&#39;s all trips and hooks.  Several originals surround these covers, including the Spanish version of &quot;Changing the Colors&quot; (English language version appears on Nuggets II) and others, some of which are throwaway but a few of them gems.  I know I&#39;ll eventually go in and try to find out more about this great and strange band, but for now I&#39;m going to keep rocking El Esquimal and just ride with the enigma and with the groove.  </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a quick entry to tell you about my Band of the Week, or month maybe.   I don&#39;t how or why I&#39;ve gone this long without hearing about the Greenberry Woods, but I got tipped on to them because of something else I was looking at or bought on-line, and now I have their two albums and cherish both.  They formed in Maryland in the late 80s and between then and 1995 recorded two long players, <em>Rapple Dapple</em> and <em>Big Money Item</em>.  Both are power pop gems, with vocal hooks around every corner and some nice distorted guitar work.  Each album has filler material on it, but each also has three songs which are power pop hall-of-famers. Like just about every power pop band that has ever existed, the &#39;Woods owe much to <strong>Alex Chilton</strong> and <strong>Big Star</strong>, whose sound they quite clearly emulate. If you are into power pop, if you like <strong>the Posies</strong>, <strong>Guided by Voice</strong>s, <strong>New Pornographers</strong>, <strong>dB&#39;s</strong>, <strong>Dwight Twilley Band</strong>, etc, etc, do what you need to do to buy the two Greenberry Woods records.  After the two albums the band split up, apparently because there were too many creative forces under one roof (heard that before).  Some core members went on to form Splitsville, who seem to be somethning of a camp/novelty act and who I have not yet explored.  Could be a future blog.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When 3-year old Shalini Chatterjee discovered the cartoon<strong> Ã¢â‚¬Å“Josie and the PussycatsÃ¢â‚¬Â</strong> on Scottish TV, this brought on a fascination with music and performance. These interests developed into a lifestyle when she immersed herself in the indie rock scene around the University of Wisconsin in the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ80s.  Later, a relationship with <strong>Game Theory</strong> main-man <strong>Scott Miller</strong> led to her meeting <strong>Mitch Easter</strong> Ã¢â‚¬â€œ<strong> LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Active</strong> mastermind and producer of early <strong>R.E.M. </strong>and many other college radio luminaries in the heyday of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ80s indie rock; she and Easter are now married, play on each otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s records, and live in North Carolina. After releasing two albums while fronting the band Vinyl Devotion, Shalini (current band name) released her/their masterpiece (thus far) in 2004; <em>Metal Corner</em> is an album of spellbinding <strong>Power Pop</strong> Ã¢â‚¬â€œ something like <strong>Cheap Trick</strong> if they had a cool girl singer.  In late 2007 ShaliniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second album, <em>The Surface and the Shine</em>, appeared and continued to explore the terrain of catchy, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ80s-influenced pop songs driven by Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ70s-style power chord riffs.  Shalini, currently busy organizing a 5-day film and music festival which will take place this summer, recently took time out to have the following e-conversation with me:   </p>
<p>*You seem to have had an interesting upbringing, being born in India  and spending your early years in Scotland. Can you tell me about  your family, what you all were doing in India and what prompted the  move to Scotland? When, where, and why did you first move to the  States? Where did you spend your teen years?   </p>
<p><em> My dad is Indian. He&#39;s from an old Calcutta family. The big family  house still exists. He had a job as a country doctor of sorts in  rural Northern India, which is why they were living there when I was  born. The place was really beautiful and green and peaceful. It&#39;s  called Digboi, near Margarita, near Assam, where the tea comes from.   </em></p>
<p><em>My parents decided to move to the USA for various reasons. They were  attracted to Los Angeles, and my dad was offered a job at UCLA, so  after living in Edinburgh for 4 years, we packed up and landed in LA  in 1973. I had never heard an American accent. Everything seemed big  and either deluxe or rundown. In Edinburgh, things were on smaller  scale but were kept up. No crappy buildings. We moved around a few  times in LA, living in Amherst, then South Pasadena (it was a pokey  cute place back then not the crowded overpriced spot it has become,  although the nice small Norton Simon art museum still exists), then  Rancho Palos Verdes on the peninsula. </em></p>
<p><em>Then they decided to move to  Northern California, which was kind of a bummer for everyone. We all  liked Los Angeles.   We moved to nearby Davis, California. I had a great  elementary school- Pioneer Elementary &#8211; with awesome 5th and 6th grade  teachers, a lot of nice friends and an excellent Girl Scout troop. I  loved singing with the other girls, going on nature walks, and  camping. I earned every badge I could until my sash was full. Teen  years were spent going to high school in Sacramento. Black years,  nothing much to say except I was immersed in bands and music. </em></p>
<p><em>There  were a lot of great bands in Davis back in the 80s. I was often too  young to go to the shows but snuck in house parties to see the early  Camper Van Beethoven shows, stuff like that. I read the news on KDVS  &#8211; I was in high school so they wouldn&#39;t let me DJ &#8211; and I worked at  the local records store in town called Barney&#39;s where some band  people worked. People assumed I was older than 16 and 17. I moved out  of the house when I was 17 to attend the University of Wisconsin and  joined my first band in the first week there. I had taken four bass  lessons that summer, so thought maybe I was passable, ha-ha.  Obviously, I am a self-taught rock musician.</em>     </p>
<p>*Do you have siblings?   </p>
<p><em>Yes. I have an older sister named Sharmila. She became a doctor and  has a Master&#39;s in Public Health from Harvard. I am not sure if she  practices medicine any more &#8211; doesn&#39;t seem to want to talk about her  job, ever &#8211; all I know is she is on staff at Boston University. She&#39;s  a couple years older. My brother Arun is 4 years and 4 days younger  than I am. He is a teacher and lives in Sacramento. That&#39;s everyone.</em>   </p>
<p>*Were/are any of your family members interested in music or other  arts? Did any of them have anything to do with you deciding to  become a musician and performer? Did you have any other early  influences that may have guided you into having creative ambitions?   </p>
<p><em>Sharmila liked bands and the indie scene. I snuck out of the house  and hitched a ride with her to see my first live band, the Bangles in  1983 playing at a small club called Club Minimal (apt name) in  Sacramento. No one in my family is musical and they don&#39;t seem  interested in art at all. I can&#39;t really relate to anyone in my  family. It feels like Them and Me. </em></p>
<p><em>I really got inspiration from  things I heard; I always had my ears open and was mesmerized by  music, obsessed with songs I thought were good and recordings that  seemed so powerful. There were three singles my dad had that  influenced me: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Baby LoveÃ¢â‚¬Â by the Supremes, Ã¢â‚¬Å“From Me to YouÃ¢â‚¬Â by the  Beatles and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rock a Hula BabyÃ¢â‚¬Â (awesome drums!!!) by Elvis. </em></p>
<p><em>And of  course there was Josie and the Pussycats which looked like the ideal  existence to me when I was 3 and watched it Tuesday nights in  Edinburgh. I loved the colors, the action, and the music. And their  costumes! And I thought Josie was such a cool name, and the fact she  was the band leader was just the center of the universe</em>.     </p>
<p>*You started playing the bass at age 17. When did you start playing  with other people? When did you start writing your own songs?   </p>
<p><em>I started playing with other people in the dorm at UW-Madison, out of  our state dorm called Princeton House. We had a semi-joke punk band  called Phlegm. My stage name was Phlegm Fatale. We played our first  gig at a birthday party in the dorm in September 1986. My knees were  shaking, I was so nervous to be standing in front of people Playing  in a Band! I started trying to write songs in 1987. It was harder than I  thought it would be. I co-wrote with Ryan Jerving of Kissyfish. He  was more of a proper musician, had played in jazz bands and was a  really, really good guitar player.</em>   </p>
<p>*How did playing with Kissyfish and the other bands lead to you forming Vinyl Devotion, then Shalini?   </p>
<p><em>Phlegm split into two bands that became Madison mainstays in the late  eighties: My Cousin Kenny, and Kissyfish. I was the bass player and  singer in Kissyfish. We played with Otis Ball some in the late 80s,  who tried to get Bar None interested in us, and eventually wrote some  really good songs, but the guys wouldn&#39;t give up this corny  vaudeville posturing, so I wasn&#39;t totally sorry when the band split  up in 1990 when we graduated. I wanted to be in the Pixies, playing  rock music, not some frat band with accordians. Ow. We made  recordings on 4 tracks and sold cassettes. I still get requests for  them over the internet.   </em></p>
<p><em>When I moved to San Francisco in 1990, I didn&#39;t know what to do. I  really wanted to play in my boyfriend Scott Miller&#39;s band Game  Theory. They needed a bass player, and never really had a cool one  after Suzi Zielger left in 1985. I had a lot of experience playing  by then, and had become a real bar rat in my years in Kissyfish. I  could have handled the transition to a more grown up band easily and  was as good as Suzi in 1990. However, Scott was adamant about not  wanting his girlfriend in his band after 2 psycho girlfriend  experiences. I thought that was pretty lame, because I was way more  responsible and sane than those other girls could ever be, but I  wasn&#39;t going to beg! </em></p>
<p><em>So I just played with two or three bands that  weren&#39;t going anywhere for a while.   I had my own vision for a band, so started Vinyl Devotion by recording a single in 1992, produced by Scott and recorded at Paul Wieneke&#39;s home studio for $15 an hour! Paul was super nice and played keyboards on my cover of &quot;Nobody Told Me.&quot;  Scott contributed his really excellent background vocals. I played  guitar and bass. I was seriously working on my songwriting all the  time by then. </em></p>
<p><em>I established my own record label called Mitochondria  Records and got distribution by making a zillion phone calls.  It was fun and easy to do the single; the hard part was putting a  band together. I killed myself looking, placing ads and holding  auditions. As soon as I had some stability, someone quit. Booking was  so hard in SF. It was all extremely difficult. A highlight was the  band in 1994. Our first EP (out on CD! Can you imagine that being a  big deal now? But this was 14 years ago! World was a different place)  got great attention. I got letters (typed!) of interest and met with  A &amp; M records in NYC in 1995. Sadly, they wanted another Courtney  Love. There is probably no one less like me on earth than her! I  couldn&#39;t pretend to be an aggressive drug addict.</em>   </p>
<p>*Do you find it easier to work with male band-mates than with other  women?   </p>
<p><em>Yes. The girls are flakey and/or psycho, the ones I&#39;ve ever worked  with, except a couple in all these years. They don&#39;t work on their  musicianship and are not generally reliable.</em>   </p>
<p>*Describe the relationship you have had with the two labels youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve  recorded for, Parasol and Dalloway. Why are you moving away from  Dalloway with this next album?   </p>
<p><em>Parasol was great! Friendly, opened some doors, had other good bands.  Some people who work there are musicians, notably the awesome Angie  Heaton and Paul Chastain. Dalloway was run by two women I could  really relate to on a musical level. They liked the 80s and  especially 90s girl-led bands a lot, that I could identify with, like  the Breeders, Veruca Salt, Throwing Muses, Garbage, and the Lovelies  from the 2000-era. </em></p>
<p><em>A lot of the indie purists around here sniff at  some of the music I like the best. None of it has a country twinge,  maybe that&#39;s why. NC indie musicians are prone to going country. I  don&#39;t even own an acoustic guitar and I wouldn&#39;t be seen in overalls  unless I was pitching hay. </em></p>
<p><em>Eve and Christina were interested in  being urban and stylish. They moved to Boston and had trouble keeping their label afloat. They had probably lost quite a bit of money on Metal Corner. I had the  chance to go with Electric Devil/125 Records so I took it. I still  keep in touch with the Dalloways, and if we&#39;re ever in Boston we&#39;ll  hook up.</em>   </p>
<p>*You play bass in the studio and guitar live Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which, if either  (both?) do you write songs on?   </p>
<p><em>I write songs on electric guitar.</em> </p>
<p>*Where and when did you first meet husband/band-mate Mitch Easter?  Did the romance form before or after the musical kinship developed,  or was it all wrapped up in one?   </p>
<p><em>I first met Mitch in July, 1991 when Scott and I went to see him play  in Marshall Crenshaw&#39;s touring band. Mitch and I got together in 1995  or 1996, after I had split up with Scott, contrary to negative gossip  about &quot;overlapping&quot;. I lived alone in a SF apartment for a couple  years and Mitch and I were long distance. I moved here Christmas Eve  1996. Mitch and I didn&#39;t play music together regularly for a long  time. He was super busy in the studio in the late nineties. I started  playing with him and Eric Marshall in 1999. They were such pros.  After all the many, many years slogging through practices with bad  musicians, it felt like flying, playing with these guys. They were  fun band-mates. We had really good synergy for a while and ended up  playing together for 7 years. I play live with another drummer now,  Chris Garges of Charlotte.</em>   </p>
<p>*What other interests do you have besides music?   </p>
<p><em>Reading, walking, dogs, animal protection, environmental causes, and  film. I started a film festival called the Revolve Film and Music  Festival, the state&#39;s only regional Triad-to-Triangle festival with  monthly screenings revolving around a 5-day core festival in June. I  used to work at another film festival but just had a lot of other  more positive programming ideas involving art and music and style.  They screen some films I find questionable and do not use violence  warnings.</em>   </p>
<p>*Write out the index of what would be a Shalini desert island mixtape  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 10-20 of your favorite all-time songs.   </p>
<p><em>Of course, this changes all the time but here&#39;s a rough mish-mash  list that isn&#39;t thought out, just off the top of my head:   </em></p>
<p><em>The Real World, <strong>Bangles</strong>;  Surrender/anything from </em><em>In Color, <strong>Cheap Trick</strong>;  Shayla, Union City Blues, <strong>Blondie</strong>;  25, Get Back, The Speed of Candy, <strong>Veruca Salt</strong>;  Don&#39;t Let Me Down, <strong>Nina Gordon</strong>;  Remember You, <strong>Chris White (Zombies)</strong>;  Friend of Mine, Jealousy, Supernova, Cinco de Mayo, <strong>Liz Phair</strong>;  No Aloha, <strong>Breeders</strong>;  Easy Does, Room with a View, Let&#39;s Active (really all of Cypress); 24 (all of Real Nighttime), Together Now Very Minor, Dripping with Looks, Game Theory;  Don&#39;t Bother Me While I&#39;m Living Forever, Slit My Wrists, <strong>Loud Family</strong>;  Phonograph, <strong>Stateside</strong>;  White Leather, <strong>the Lovelies</strong>;  West of the Fields/We Walk/Shaking Through/Perfect Circle &#8211; R.E.M.; Our Lips are Sealed/How Much More/Fading Fast/I&#39;m With you/Mercenary  &#8211; <strong>Go-Go&#39;s</strong>, who were underrated songwriters;  <strong>Nina Nastasia</strong> &#8211; I like her as an artist but can&#39;t name her song titles;  Blue Spark/Los Angeles/+ many others &#8211; <strong>X</strong></em>     </p>
<p>*How do you like living in North Carolina, as compared to the other  parts of the U.S. and the world that you have lived in?   </p>
<p><em>I like it. It&#39;s a great place to have a band! People have pretty much  space, it&#39;s low crime, and there are a lot of talented musicians.</em> </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  Like my entry on the writer Ted Lewis, I am going to write about somebody who is not a musician but is definitely rock and roll.  <strong>Mimsy Farmer</strong> is my favorite actress, and the mere fact that she had a prominent role in the film <em><strong>Riot On Sunset Strip</strong></em> makes her Lost in the Grooves worthy.  Here&#39;s my take on the wild-eyed girl from Chicago:        </p>
<p>Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  Mimsy Farmer has led a charmed life as an actress.  At age 22, the native Chicagoan scored a part in <em>Riot on Sunset Strip</em>, one of the hippest films made in the <strong>Summer of Love</strong>.  Moreover, she got what was arguably the most dramatic moment in the movie, playing the victim of a bad trip in the obligatory acid freakout scene.  Then, when the 60Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s were over, rather than stooping to taking roles in schmaltzy 70Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s films or just fading into obscurity, she got in with the European set, moved to Italy and spent the next two decades starring in a slew of cult Euro horror and crime films, directed by <strong>Dario Argento</strong> and the like. 	</p>
<p>Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  As much hipster credibility and critical acclaim Riot and all the horror flicks might have gotten her, though, none of these films were among the ones which defined Mimsy as an actress. She had a <strong>Great Trilogy</strong>, three films which represent the nadir of her acting life. 	</p>
<p>Mimsy Farmer is a danger girl.  Her natural beauty calls attention to her, and once you get a close look you see that there is something volatile lurking behind the pretty eyes and inside the head covered by the cute page-boy haircut.  Film directors clearly recognized this unstable facet of MimsyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s being, as they were always casting her in peril-filled, if not outright violent, roles and scenes.  Sometimes she was the victim and other times the perpetrator, but in either case there was just always trouble surrounding her. 	</p>
<p>Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  <em><strong>Hot Rods to Hell</strong></em>, the first in the Great Mimsy Triolgy, came out in 1967, the same year as <em>Riot on Sunset Strip</em>, but had a decidedly 50Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s-ish feel to it.  <strong>Dana Andrews </strong>plays a Ward Cleaver type who experiences trauma as he, his wife and teenage daughter move to a new town, where they are terrorized by a trio of young delinquents.  Mimsy portrays Gloria, the mercurial moll of the little gang.  	 In the most memorable scene of the film, Mimsy, her boyfriend and his best friend are sitting in a parked car at a LoverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Lane kind of locale.  MimsyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s boyfriend, after having an argument with her, gets out of the car and goes over to talk to AndrewsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pretty teenage daughter, who is sitting by herself near some water and looking pensive.  Mimsy responds to this by first slamming her fists on the steering wheel, then biting her own finger. Next, just when you think sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to start crying or maybe go after her boyfriend, a psychotic smile suddenly spreads across her face.  She reaches over and starts pulling her boyfriendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hair, and when he cries uncle she lays a passionate kiss on him.  After that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hers.  The best bit of dialogue in the film comes across when Mimsy talks to her former boyfriend about what might have been possible for them if theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been able to stay together, bringing out his response, Ã¢â‚¬Å“WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d we ever have that wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t gonna wind up in Splitsville?Ã¢â‚¬Â 	</p>
<p>Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  <em><strong>More</strong></em> (1969), <strong>Barbet SchroederÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s</strong> (<em>Barfly, Reversal of Fortune, Single White Female</em>) directorial debut, and the middle piece of the Great Mimsy Trilogy, has become a cinematic footnote for the fact that it features a soundtrack by <strong>Pink Floyd</strong>.  But this a great, under-appreciated film which was looking a few years ahead of its time in depicting the downfall of 60Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s hipster drug culture.          Stefan is a German student whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just finished his studies and is looking to spend some time tramping around Europe, experiencing life and enjoying his freedom.  While at a party in Paris he locks eyes with a pretty blonde (Mimsy, of course).  They share a round of margaritas in the kitchen, and from there he is stuck on her and about to be led into a downward-spiraling adventure which will take him through drug addiction, sexual depravity, petty crime and general personality deterioration.         StefanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friend in Paris tries to warn him off Mimsy, telling him sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a junkie and a thief who has already seen several guys like Stefan to their decay, but the dangerous Mimsy is irresistible to the hapless student.  This film is worth watching if not just for the beautiful shots of Ibiza, where Mimsy flees, giving Stefan an out to avoid the hazards she knows she will bring him; he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take the offer and follows her there, setting up the filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tragic climax.  	</p>
<p>Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  The third and final title in the Great Mimsy Trilogy is the best film she ever acted in.  The blurry, existential, voice-over happy <em><strong>Road to Salina</strong></em> (1971) is another overlooked mini-classic.           <strong>Robert Walker, Jr.</strong> (Walker, Sr. portrayed the creepy Bruno in <strong>HitchcockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s <em>Strangers on a Train</em></strong>) plays a drifting hippy whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wandering along a quiet West Coast town when he spots a house with a water well out in front of it.  Thirsty and in need of a washing, Walker indulges himself, not knowing that this is the house that will change his life.  As heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s splashing water on his face, he is confronted by the matron of the house, a clearly unbalanced woman (played by <strong>Rita Hayworth</strong>, who sadly foreshadows her real-life future here Ã¢â‚¬â€œ she suffered from AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease, becoming a confused shadow of her former self in her latter years) who takes him to be her long-lost son, Rocky. 	Walker recognizes that this is a precarious set-up, but finds that he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t turn down the promise of a hot meal and a bed to take a nap in.   And when he wakes up he starts to think that maybe itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not such a bad thing that the batty marm thinks heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s her son.  It seems that all she wants from him is his help in pumping gas and serving lunch and beer to the locals (the house is also a business, a kind of combo gas station/weekend cafÃƒÂ©).  The rest of the time heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s free to eat and sleep and shower and go to the beach.  And all he has to do is pretend to be her son and let her dote on him. 	If all of that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t totally sell him on the house, his Ã¢â‚¬Å“sisterÃ¢â‚¬Â does.  Mimsy, once again playing a wild-eyed femme fatale, eventually shows up at the house and is introduced to Walker as his sibling.  But this is a weird kind of sister: one who likes to let her brother see her naked and who takes naps with him and sleeps with him under a tent on the beach.  WalkerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s head-trip is magnified immensely as he tries to determine whether Mimsy really believes heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s her brother of if sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fucking with him Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trying to sort all of this out as heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s falling in love with her. 	Pop this film in on a rainy Sunday afternoon and you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t walk away from it.  Plus, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get to see Hayworth and the senior <strong>Ed Begley</strong> do the <strong>frug</strong>. 	</p>
<p>Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  Between <em>Riot on Sunset Strip</em> and <em>More</em>, Mimsy Farmer temporarily got out of acting and became involved in something called Ã¢â‚¬Å“<strong>psychedelic therapy</strong>,Ã¢â‚¬Â a fringe school of psychological treatment where the  Ã¢â‚¬Å“counselorsÃ¢â‚¬Â apparently dosed old drunks in hopes of getting them off the sauce.  Mimsy seems to have regarded this experiment as a failure, but the acid appears to have inspired her; having already tuned in and turned on, she dropped out of her native country, citing the moneyed shallowness prevalent in American life.  She met and married a European man and never looked back. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a set of circumstances that could be the makings of an interesting film, one starring a daring, tempestuous, willful woman Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a part perfectly suited for an actress like Mimsy Farmer.  	</p>
<p>Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  MimsyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s present whereabouts and doings are unknown.  In her bio on the <em>Hot Rods to Hell </em>website, for current residence it simply says, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Europe.Ã¢â‚¬Â  A 1997 feature article on her in <strong><em>Fuz </em>magazine</strong> reported that, since 1989 (the year of her last known film role) sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been living in semi-retirement in France, with a new husband and new daughter, and suffering from some sort of health problem.  ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all vague and maybe a little sad, but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also something triumphant in the way that Mimsy has let herself fade from the public eye quietly and gracefully; a good actress knows when itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to tone things down. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some friends and I were recently talking music (what else is new?), one of us mentioned <strong>Power Pop</strong>, and someone else not familiar with that genre asked what that was.  I muttered something about the combination of sweet vocal melodies and barre chords, somebody else starting dropping names of bands who played in the style . . . But if we really wanted to make our friend understand Power Pop, we should have just played him some songs by The Shoes.  Better yet, we should have directed him to buy <em>Double Exposure</em>, the new 2-CD collection of Shoes demos.  The 30 tracks are workbook recordings of songs that would appear on the band&#39;s two seminal albums from the late 70s/early 80s, <em>Present Tense</em> and <em>Tongue Twister</em>.    The Shoes had every right to be as popular as <strong>Cheap Trick</strong>, the<strong> Cars</strong>, et al, but somehow they never scored any hits (at least, to my knowledge).  Their melodies are sing-songy but with just enough of an edge to them &#8211; and the backing tracks are all power chords and sharp hooks. It&#39;s like Cheap Trick but more introspective, the Cars but not as slick &#8211; four shy and nondescript guys from the Midwest who had a love of melodic music and a knack for creating great pop songs. It had been a long time since I&#39;d listened to The Shoes (prior to getting this set), and I have been listening to a lot of <strong>Guided by Voices</strong> of late; hearing these demos tells me that <strong>Robert Pollard</strong> studied this band closely when forming his melodic sensibilities and his band&#39;s sound.   The Shoes songs make me feel like I&#39;m at the roller rink on a Friday night, slow dancing with my new girl, both of us with feathered hair and me with a comb in my back pocket. But this is not novelty music; it is some of the best Power Pop you&#39;ll ever hear. These demos, while not vastly different than the versions of the songs that appeared on the official records, are just raw enough to make them worth hearing for a Shoes fan.  <em>Double Exposure</em> in on the Black Vinyl label, and despite being a new release is pretty hard to get your hands on.  Make the effort. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends:  Sorry to have been away so long.  I&#39;m back and am here to tell you about Anne Briggs.  I don&#39;t care about the British Folk Revival, the phenomenon that gets mentioned in every <strong><em>Mojo</em></strong> issue about 20 times, the thing that you have to hear about every time a new Devendra Banhart (sp?) or Joanna Newson record comes out.   But Anne Briggs, while a British folkie to be sure, is a something else altogether, somebody too original and sublime to be cast in that pot.  She is a field hippy with a punk attitude, like a <strong>PJ Harvey</strong> singing ancient folk ballads.  She prefers to sing a cappella, and has never been crazy about being recorded.  She dislikes being photographed, and when caught on film she generally looks like she needs a bath and a hairbrush, and like she might be considering punching the photographer.  Her 1971 album <strong><em>The Time Has Come</em></strong> was reissued this year, and this record is what I&#39;m really writing about here.  On this record Briggs allowed herself to be accompanied by some light guitar playing, and on the two instrumental tracks she plays some rare stringed instrument herself.  This is a spellbinding album, and something that should be known as one of the great folk records of all time, instead of an album only a select few have heard.  The guitar playing is similar to that of the acoustic work on <strong><em>Led Zeppelin III</em></strong>, and Anne&#39;s vocals are something that can&#39;t really be described &#8211; they just need to be heard.  This is <strong>Nick Drake</strong> meets <strong>Judee Sill</strong>, it&#39;s acoustic Led Zeppelin with a female vocalist, it&#39;s timeless music performed by an extraordinary artist,  it&#39;s Anne Briggs . . . and it&#39;s the reissue of the year, as far as I&#39;m concerned.  Also highly worthwhile is the Anne Briggs compilation, <em>A Collection</em>, which compiles much of her best a cappella material.  The one I would skip is <em>Sing a Song For You</em>, on which Briggs is backed by the band Ragged Robin &#8211; just not the same caliber of material as is found on <em>Time Has Come</em> and <em>A Collection.</em> </p>
