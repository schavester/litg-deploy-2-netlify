					<description><![CDATA[More details on &quot;The Gas Chair&quot; and other releases can be found at http://www.crawlingchaos.co.uk/ ...Enough to satisfy the curious and clarify the Factory warblings.  This has been set up by an original member of the band, so he should know.  And it&#039;s not Uncle Harry&#039;s Last Freakout, yet.

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;I&#039;ve Got a Feeling for Love&quot; and &quot;How Can I Be Down&quot; are also two great yellow Ballooon Songs. I prefer these to the hit.  Also, forget Robbie Douglas, whatever happened to Katie, his wife on the show? There was a happenin&#039; chick!

					<description><![CDATA[So you have it from a reliable source that Lewis Taylor does in fact have new music in the works?  I saw an announcement on the HackTone Records MySpace page that Lewis had retired from the music business and that The Lost Album was going to be a post-career release here in the U.S.  That announcement about his retirement was about two months ago.  Have things changed since then?  I&#039;m going to be optimistic and hope that your sources are reliable, since I love this man&#039;s music.  The world isn&#039;t the same without Lewis&#039; music.]]></description>

Hey Tony-

Well, I can&#039;t say I&#039;m surprised to hear that Johnny Ramone wasn&#039;t a 10cc fan. But you&#039;re right, Gouldman is a great story-teller and tune-writer.  I love his own version of &quot;No Milk Today&quot; on The Graham Gould Thing. And &quot;Bus Stop&quot; - well, I&#039;ve always thought that was just about the most perfect pop song ever.  The opening track on the record, &quot;The Impossible Years,&quot; is another stunning gem of melody and storyline. Having said all of that, it would be fun to listen to Johnny ragging on &quot;I&#039;m Not in Love.&quot;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s good to see Gouldman be recognized for something other that 10cc and &#034;I&#039;m Not in Love.&#034;&#160; His three hits for Herman&#039;s Hermits -- &#034;East West,&#034; &#034;No Milk Today&#034; and &#034;Listen People,&#034; are probably the most soulful and meaningful recordings the band ever did.&#160; His way with a mini-story is equalled by his melodic inventiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I interviewed Johnny Ramone for my college newspaper in 1985, when The Ramones were on their &#034;Too Tough to Die&#034; tour.&#160; When I asked him about Gouldman (who had produced a previous Ramones LP), it sent him into a semi-comic tirade against how 10cc was wimpy&#160;and &#034;I&#039;m Not in Love&#034; was terrible.&#160; I don&#039;t think he meant to be mean, but it did show me this is the way a lot of people view Gouldman. I wish I had saved the interview tape.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i&#039;m actually very disappointed with meadow house&#039;s album - wayyy too poppy!  i&#039;d hoped that it would be a showcase of his homemade harry partch-style instruments implemented in a bitter anti-music a la epistaxis time (his most recent work, and i enjoy this much more than the hellebore stuff which was five years ago).  but it&#039;s a joke.
i think dan doesn&#039;t like people who do drugs and get intoxicated, in fact, i believe he wants to kill them... he is very educated apparently- if epistaxis is to be taken at face value!
i am always stalking this elusive character to discover more about this erratic enterprise...]]></description>
