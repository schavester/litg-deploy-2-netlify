										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blue Ash Special Bonus CD&#8217;s! </p>
<p>There will be a special limited free bonus CD when ordering Blue Ash&#8217;s &#8220;No More, No Less&#8221; from Not Lame or Kool Kat Musik. The Not Lame bonus CD will feature unreleased songs from 1973 that were done &#8220;live&#8221; in Peppermint Studios.</p>
<p>https://www.notlame.com/BLUE_ASH/Page_1/CDBLUEASH1.html</p>
<p>The tracks are:<br />
Hippy, Hippy Shake<br />
(Chan Romero)<br />
Baby You Lied<br />
(Secich- Bartolin)<br />
Now All You&#8217;ve Got Is You<br />
(Kendzor)<br />
She Cried For 15 years<br />
(Secich-Bartolin)<br />
One After 909<br />
(Lennon-McCartney)<br />
I Thought I Knew You<br />
(Secich-Bartolin)<br />
Say Goodbye<br />
(Secich-Bartolin)<br />
Give Me Love<br />
(Secich-Bartolin)<br />
Walls<br />
(Secich-Bartolin)<br />
Paper Bag Blues<br />
(Secich-Bartolin-Kendzor-Evans)<br />
Be My Girl<br />
(Secich-Bartolin)<br />
When I Get You<br />
(Secich-Bartolin)<br />
Make It Easy<br />
(Secich-Bartolin)</p>
<p>The bonus CD album with Kool Kat Musik will feature a &#8220;live&#8221; performance<br />
 of 12 songs recorded  on January 31, 1974 at the Packard Music Hall in Warren, Ohio! The band was  opening for the Raspberries at this show &#8211; and, as you&#8217;ll hear, they definitely had<br />
their &#8220;game face&#8221; on as they rock through these covers and originals:</p>
<p>Hippy Hippy Shake<br />
One After 909<br />
Do You Love Me<br />
Anytime At All<br />
Start All Over Again<br />
Plain To See<br />
What Can I Do For You<br />
She&#8217;s So Nice<br />
Baby Baby Come On<br />
All I Want<br />
Twist and Shout<br />
My Generation</p>
<p>It must be noted that this is an audience recording (the<br />
only type that exists according to the band) that, while not<br />
of the highest audio quality, captures<br />
the band at a magical moment in their career, and serves as<br />
an archival testament to the power they exhibited as a live<br />
band! You&#8217;ll still be awfully<br />
glad you snagged this little piece o&#8217; Power Pop<br />
history!</p>

<p>The Deadbeat Poets<br />
Pete Drivere, Terry Hartman, Frank Secich &#038; John Koury</p>
<p>&#8220;NOTES FROM THE UNDERGROUND&#8221;<br />
Now available at https://www.popdetective.com/</p>
<p>The Deadbeat Poets were formed in Youngstown, Ohio in the summer of 2006. The band consists of veteran Ohio musicians with eclectic credentials: Frank Secich (Blue Ash, Club Wow, Stiv Bators Band), Terry Hartman (Backdoor Men, Napoleon In Rags, Terry &#038; The Tornadoes), Pete Drivere (Infidels, Pretty Demons) and John Koury (Infidels, Slackjaw). Their debut album (which was recorded over the first few months of 2007 at Youngstown&#8217;s Ampreon Recorder) will be released on Pop Detective Records in July of 2007 and in late summer in Japan on Vivid Sound Records. Also, making guest appearances on the album are Bill &#8220;Cupid&#8221; Bartolin on guitar and Chris Leonardi on piano and organ. </p>
<p>Soon, you&#8217;ll be able to sit back and relax (pop the top and set the sail) as the Deadbeat Poets take you on a timely journey. To such places&#8230;. romantic places like Beaver Falls (via Mahoningtown) you&#8217;ll go. You&#8217;ll travel to the exotic northside of Youngstown, Cleveland, the depths of the Atlantic Ocean, Toronto, Geneva-On-The-Lake, New York, LA, London, the far reaches of outer space, Paris, Mt. Pilot, The Bering Sea, St. Paul and of course Buffalo, NY. You&#8217;ll meet fun lovin&#8217;, sex-crazed aliens in &#8220;The Truth About Flying Saucers&#8221;. You&#8217;ll hear the tale of the legendary Ray Robinson who once roamed the dark, back-country roads of Western, PA in &#8220;The Green Man&#8221;. You&#8217;ll encounter semi-romantic mountain men and their passions in &#8220;Ernest T&#8221; and ride along with Stiv Bators as he once terrorized the western world in &#8220;The Stiv Bators Ghost Tour&#8221;. You&#8217;ll find out the connection between Ernest Hemmingway and Gertrude Stein and French bidets in &#8220;Where Was I When I Needed Me?&#8221;. You&#8217;ll raise glasses and bottles with the lads in &#8220;No Island Like The Mind, No Ship Like Beer&#8221; and be sadly disappointed by gangsters and thieves as &#8220;The Goody Wagon&#8221; never arrives. If floating in a psychedelic flutter is your inclination then &#8220;What Part Of Cognitive Dissonance Don&#8217;t You Understand?&#8221; will probably be your cup of tea. Then again, you may find that after all of this &#8230;..well that &#8220;It&#8217;s Nothing&#8221; to you. Then again, you may start getting &#8220;A Funny Little Feeling&#8221; that you will enjoy the Deadbeat Poets. </p>
<p>AVAILABLE NOW! https://www.popdetective.com/ </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blue Ash is a Lost in the Grooves artist. <a href="https://www.maryattmusic.com/search_results_cd.php?cd=MMG+292&#038;artist=206" target="_blank">Click</a> to sample the music or purchase tracks from <em>Around Again &#8211; A Collection of Rarities From the Vault 1972-1979</em>. And keep an eye peeled to Frank Secich&#8217;s <a href="/?p=979" target="_self">Blue Ash blog</a> here at LITG for news, photos and insights straight from the band. This reissue (of a double CD first put out by the good folks at Not Lame) is just the start, as we&#8217;ll soon be digging deeper into the Blue Ash vaults for songs never before heard by fans.</p>
<p>Metal Mike Saunders provided this vintage record review for the <em>Lost in the Grooves</em> anthology:</p>
<blockquote><p>Blue Ash <em>No More, No Less</em> (Mercury, 1973)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I Remember A Time&rdquo; could do for Blue Ash what &ldquo;Mr. Tambourine Man&rdquo; did for the Byrds: the start of a brilliant career, a Number One hit, instant mythology. The guitar intro lasts all of five seconds before Jimmy Kendzor and Frank Secich&#8217;s voices come in, oozing of everything the Byrds and Lovin&#8217; Spoonful ever promised, the soaring harmonies in the chorus driving over jangling lead guitar work. It&#8217;s the sound of tomorrow right here today, it&#8217;s the perfect folk-rock single. It&#8217;s beautiful, that&#8217;s what.</p>
<p>This is one of the most spirited, powerful debuts ever from an American group. <em>No More, No Less</em> opens with &ldquo;Have you Seen Her,&rdquo; a fast rocker kicked off by four whomps on David Evans&#8217; snare. This is the one that makes me think of The Who; the lead guitar is pure West Coast, though.</p>
<p>&quot;Just Another Game&rdquo; is the one quiet song, an effective tonedown before &ldquo;I Remember A Time.&rdquo; &ldquo;Plain To See&rdquo; is similar to &ldquo;I Remember A Time&rdquo; in the way its simple, compelling melody rocks out with vocal harmonies framed over a trebly Byrds guitar sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here We Go Again&rdquo; follows, midway between the hardest and softest numbers on the first side. What&#8217;s great here are the group vocals on top of the tuff folk-rock cum hard rock instrumental sound; it&#8217;s like killing two birds with one stone, the whole premise behind the old and new Mod groups (Small Faces, early Who, the Sweet), not to mention the hard pop masterpiece known to the world as &ldquo;Do Ya.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time this album ends, there&#8217;s no doubt about it, Blue Ash have got themselves one hell of a debut LP that may send fellow stateside groups like Stories, the Raspberries, and Big Star running back to the woodshed to come up with music even better than their present stuff.
