<p>Dream Lake Ukulele Band<br /> Dream Lake Ukulele Band<br /> (Crest, 1976)</p>
<p> What do you get when you cross twenty-seven ukuleles, a Little Marcy record, and the Langley Schools Music Project? The result is a bizarre hybrid called the Dream Lake Ukulele Band, a Florida school group whose performances are documented on Crest Records, a New York vanity label. The back cover shows twenty-seven grade school aged students, all wearing white shirts and red vests, the boys also wearing neckties. Sound boring? Not when every kid is smiling and holding a ukulele. </p>
<p> The lead-off, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s So Many, Many Ways,&rdquo; is one of the more charming Christian songs around, but I&rsquo;m sure my opinion is altered by the sheer innocent joy of twenty-seven children&rsquo;s voices singing in harmony while strumming their ukuleles. That spirit changes a bit though, when the songs veer off into the Bicentennial patriotic songs that fill the rest of Side 1. Such lyrics as &quot;My Sunday school teacher loves me when I am never late&quot; preceded by &quot;God loves when I learn to shoot the gun&quot; makes one wish that the band director would have been cool enough to be teaching the kids David Bowie songs.</p>
<p> Fortunately, Side 2 has the perfect antidote, for that is where the children present and sing their own original compositions. Compiled under headings such as &quot;Wish Songs,&quot; &quot;Name Songs,&quot; and &quot;Music Songs,&quot; each features a progression of five to ten kids strumming and singing solo. These aren&rsquo;t loud bratty kids singing &quot;Tomorrow&quot; at the top of their lungs, but more often small waif-like girls singing with very timid voices.&nbsp; My heart melts whenever I hear one girl who sings, &quot;I am Mary, I like to play the ukulele&quot; or another girl whose verse starts by saying her parents are always busy, and then proceeds with &quot;Daddy is a band director, Mommy is a piano teacher, I love them.&quot; This record is listed as being Volume Seven, which definitely makes me wish that I also had volumes One through Six. (Vern Stolz, from the book Lost in the Grooves) </p>
