<p>Sex Clark 5 <em>Strum &amp; Drum!</em>  (Records to Russia, 1987/ Beehive Rebellion, 1996)  </p>
<p>Hailing from Huntsville, AlabamaÃ¢â‚¬â€the place where Wernher von Braun traded rocketry know-how for immunity, but perhaps more significantly birthplace of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Eight Miles HighÃ¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â‚¬â€these lo-fi pop wunderkinder had one of the eightiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ great lost discs in Strum &amp; Drum! Their name is one of the broad strokes forming a sly humored sensibility, this from a group also given to titling a noisy piss-take Ã¢â‚¬Å“Get Back Yoko,Ã¢â‚¬Â and producing an electronic loop of the phrase Ã¢â‚¬Å“Girls of Somalia,Ã¢â‚¬Â apparently a 5th dimensional play on the Beach BoysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ celebrations of regional pulchritude. But these are the oddities on a disc thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 95% ebullient, near-perfect Beatlesque pop, delivered with careless glee all but unheard of in the power pop ghetto. None of singer/guitarist James ButlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s twenty songs clocks in above 2:43, giving them the opportunity to charm without boring. SC5 leaves you wanting more, but with the next unforgettable melody never far away. Take Ã¢â‚¬Å“Detention Girls,Ã¢â‚¬Â a reductive micro opera with a cheerleaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chant giving the if-you-blinked-you-missed-it bridge that extra jolt sending the whole marvelous package into sugary hyperdrive. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Modern FixÃ¢â‚¬Â is at once daffy and poignant. The powerfully delivered line Ã¢â‚¬Å“Why donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t we take all our gimmicks, put Ã¢â‚¬Ëœem all in one box/ And trade Ã¢â‚¬Ëœem for a bag of tube socks?Ã¢â‚¬Â seems (and is) absurd on its face, but in context itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the possibly final plea of a lover trying to make a rough love work. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ValerieÃ¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s singsong melody seems somehow backwards, an exquisite medieval meander fused with a sweetness straight out of the McCartney songbook. Lightning-paced Ã¢â‚¬Å“AlaiÃ¢â‚¬Â is blessed with one of those hooks that wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quit, though what the Ã¢â‚¬Å“alai-lai-lai-laiÃ¢â‚¬Â the band is on about may never be revealed. Sometimes bassist Joy Johnson sings in the sweet, slightly flat voice of a serious little kid, but mostly Butler leads the show, mouth racing to keep up with the shambling, ecstatic rush of his band. These dizzy, precise little tunes are like musical meringues, each one a brilliant gem of an idea whipped to soft, gooey peaks. Look for the out-of-print 1996 CD reissue that includes the magical early Ã¢â‚¬Å“Neita Grew Up Last NightÃ¢â‚¬Â EP. (Kim Cooper, from the book<em> Lost in the Grooves</em>) </p>
