<p>Juviley is the project of Israeli musician Or Zubalsky, who toured widely with Israel&#39;s leading indie acts Shy Nobleman, Geva Alon, Daphna &amp; The Cookies. At 21, he began writing his own songs, and revealed a tender, delicate sensibility far removed from the stereotypical dumb drummer. Inspired by the chamber pop of Brian Wilson, Nick Drake and Belle and Sebastian, on his debut album <em>How To Miss The Ground</em> Or plays nearly every instrument himself. With its heartbreaking simplicity, bittersweet melodies and thoughtful arrangements it creates a unique, dreamlike atmosphere. Once the record was completed, Or moved to New York City, where he plays regularly, in clubs and on the streets.</p>
<p>The critics love Juviley&#39;s <em>How To Miss The Ground.</em> Palebear muses, &quot;I sort of needed this album to right my sanity&#8230; beautiful, pastoral&#8230; equal parts Kings of Convenience, Mojave 3 and Belle and Sebastian.&quot; And Caroline Leonardo says it&#39;s &quot;an articulate collection of songs sure to warm your soul with pleasant melodies and story-like lyrics&#8230; an acoustic dream with the kind of tunes that&#39;ll lift your spirits during a rainy day&#8230; [it] is one of those rare debuts that carry a lot of clout. This well orchestrated album comes off gentle and well meaning without being pretentious or overbearing in the way that it&#39;s so simple and true. Indie pop has never sounded so good.&quot; </p>
