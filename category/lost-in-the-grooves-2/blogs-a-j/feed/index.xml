<p>Attention, Lost Groovers everywhere:</p>
<p>Your assignment today is to gather together in one medium-sized concert facility, for one evening only, one dozen of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most popular entertainers. Age, style, size, corporate affiliation and particularly musical pigeonhole is to be strictly of no concern whatsoever. Each act just has to have had a heck of a lot of their songs downloaded, perhaps maybe even sold, over the past calendar year or so.</p>
<p>Then, with a bare minimum of rehearsal or directorial guidelines of any sort Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and an equally bare-boned budget to boot Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a two-hour concert has to sequenced, scored, choreographed and executed upon a single stage utilizing all these chosen singers, dancers and accompanists, the entire proceedings recorded and videoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d completely live, music <em>and</em> vocals, without re-takes, and the resultant miles of tape then edited, printed, promoted and distributed for public viewing into theatres. </p>
<p>Oh. And this all has to be completed within the period of a mere <em>fourteen days</em>, from show-date to release-date, by the way.</p>
<p>Finished laughing? Of course in a 21st century scheme of things such an endeavor would scarcely get past the imagining stage I agree, quickly dismissed out-of-hand (not to mention out-of-mind) as completely unfeasible; one legal, logistical Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not to mention <em>ego</em>-tistical Ã¢â‚¬â€œ nightmare of gargantuan proportions.  </p>
<p><em>But</em>, in that strange and distant galaxy known as The Sixties, where anything seemed possible, everything was tried at least once, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“noÃ¢â‚¬Â was a word only uttered when speaking to people over thirty, undertakings of such grand socio-musical import were thought no more impractical than, say, making orange juice out of freeze-dried crystals then flying with them all the way to the moon and back. </p>
<p>What <em>is</em> hard to believe, however, is that one such concert event filmed inside the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium on the night of October 29, 1964 in front of a few hundred local high school students should not only survive to be released on DVD, but that its one hundred and twelve monochrome minutes remain as utterly entertaining, and downright engrossing, all these forty-five years later.</p>
<p><em>The TAMI Show: CollectorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Edition</em>, now finally available from our friends over at <a href="https://www.shoutfactory.com/browse/312/the_tami_show.aspx"><strong>Shout! Factory</strong></a> is, you see, simply so, <em>so</em> much more than merely <em>Monterey Pop</em> without the lysergic, <em>Woodstock</em> without the mudslides or, yes, Altamont minus pool cues and homicide victims. True, one <em>could</em> consider this film as Ã¢â‚¬Å“justÃ¢â‚¬Â the single most frantically paced, ultra-high-decibel time capsule of an extraordinary era ever preserved on disc. Or even, as Quentin Tarantino most assuredly claims, Ã¢â‚¬Å“in the top three of all rock movies.Ã¢â‚¬Â </p>
<p>I will go all that one further, however: <em>The TAMI Show</em> (as in <em>Teenage Awards Music International</em>, by the way) is absolutely essential viewing to anyone and everyone who consider themselves fans, followers, and/or students of popular music. </p>
<p>Period.             </p>
<p>Allow me to elaborate. The dozen acts, co-hosts <a href="https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2010/03/19/arts/tami.jandean.jpg"><strong>Jan and Dean</strong></a> sing whilst skateboarding across the opening credits, did indeed come Ã¢â‚¬Å“From All Over The World.Ã¢â‚¬Â Not to mention everywhere across the musical map as well: Kicked off by Ã¢â‚¬Å“the guy who started it allÃ¢â‚¬Â as Jan (no relation) Berry announces, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0yGXKoA6Ek"><strong>Chuck Berry</strong></a> duck-walks us all the way from St. Louis to New York City, where the about-to-be- renovated Brill Building sound is sung most proudly and loudly by none other than <a href="https://www.broadwayworld.com/columnpic/Lesley2.jpg"><strong>Lesley Gore</strong></a> (whose proto-feminist lyrics and attitude herein should have all you brand new Runaways fans repositioning the birth of grrrl-rock once and for all). </p>
<p>The magnificent Motor City is then represented by Smokey Robinson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ pay particular attention to his MiraclesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ dance-steps during <a href="https://www.coffeecoffeeandmorecoffee.com/archives/tami%20show%201.jpg"><strong>Ã¢â‚¬Å“MickeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s MonkeyÃ¢â‚¬Â</strong></a> Ã¢â‚¬â€œ along with superstars-in-waiting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8_Uh5gjUFE"><strong>Marvin Gaye</strong></a> (who performs two songs soon to be recorded by a waiting-in-the-wings Rolling Stones) and <a href="https://interactive.wxxi.org/files/images/highlights/TAMI.jpg"><strong>The Supremes</strong></a> (poised to leave behind forever their branding as Ã¢â‚¬Å“those no-hit SupremesÃ¢â‚¬Â with an historic string of global million-sellers). Meanwhile, England swings Santa Monica via <a href="https://www.ronellis.co.uk/images/books/Billy%20J%20Kramer%20&amp;%20George%20Harrison.jpg"><strong>Billy J. Kramer</strong></a> with his Dakotas plus <a href="https://www.gerryandthepacemakers.co.uk/Kari1/gerry-in-california.jpg"><strong>Gerry and the Pacemakers</strong></a> (Ã¢â‚¬Â¦four of impresario Brian EpsteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s other clients unfortunately occupied overseas at this point in time, putting finishing touches onto <em>Beatles For Sale </em>it seems). </p>
<p>Why, even what we now know and love as that runt of the musical litter, Garage Rock, is represented by none other than the aptly-named Barbarians and their, I kid you not, one-handed drummist Victor <a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_FKxj7S66vU4/SIOmF_wSEfI/AAAAAAAAA5I/MokdT2Eq4Ag/s400/moulty%2B45"><strong>Ã¢â‚¬Å“MoultyÃ¢â‚¬Â</strong></a> Moulton. Plus special note must here be made of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDIBMaCTwFw"><strong>The Beach Boys</strong></a>Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ four-song set, propelled practically through the roof by <em>their</em> drummer Dennis, as this particular footage was removed from most every existing print of <em>The TAMI Show</em> soon after release and has only now been fully reinstated in all its harmony-drenched, sun-kissed, Surf City splendor.     </p>
<p>And <em>then!</em> As impossible to pin down geographically Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not to mention musically or even vocally Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as he remained for the rest of his career comes the one, the only, the hardest- working <a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PCQ6dwBnOyA/S6mevNj033I/AAAAAAAAA5M/xvvxAVmynqY/s1600/James+knees.jpg"><strong>James Brown</strong></a>. </p>
<p>Now itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been said before, but IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll just have to say it again (and again and again): His performance in <em>The TAMI Show</em> remains one of the most jaw-dropping, above-kinetic, gut-<em>and</em>-thigh-ripping performances <em>ever</em> executed. EVER. Anytime, any place, by <em>any</em> one. <em>Everything</em> you may have heard about this man and these particular eighteen minutes (e.g., Ã¢â‚¬Å“the single greatest rock Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll performance ever captured on filmÃ¢â‚¬Â: Rick Rubin) is absolutely, one-<em>thousand</em>-per-cent true. Just look at it yourself if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe me Ã¢â‚¬Â¦or everyone else who has ever seen it.</p>
<p>Somehow, those newly-rolling, <em>original</em> Stones Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with Brian Jones and even <a href="https://lh6.ggpht.com/_8HkLzUmw8AQ/S5XPwJ5s0KI/AAAAAAAAAeU/-NGjzRsMBJk/tami1.jpg"><strong>Bill Wyman</strong></a>Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s vocal mic present Ã¢â‚¬â€œ arose to the task of following Butane James that fateful night, and their performance closed the event, and the film, with a mixture of pure, simply pimply beat Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ soul which wins over even many of the pole-axed teens whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d just survived James BrownÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s set. </p>
<p>Finally, cue the entire cast and assembled dancers (watch closely for <a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/__mokxbTmuJM/S7droSqoL4I/AAAAAAAAE9o/hYMmRXOTN6c/s1600/TeriGarrTAMIShow.jpg"><strong>a very young Teri Garr!</strong></a>) back onstage to frug a mighty big storm up around Jagger and Richard(s) and, scarcely two hours after it all began, the curtain drops. </p>
<p>So, just another night of music, mayhem, and undeniable magic out in L.A. during the fall of Ã¢â‚¬â„¢64, right? But what novice <a href="https://media.thestar.topscms.com/images/57/ce/237364f1487e88abb29cbd607a58.jpeg"><strong>director Steve Binder</strong></a> and his crew captured, and what today is immaculately preserved upon <em>The TAMI Show</em> DVD, is busting-full of rich musical (I repeat: James Brown) <em>and</em> cinematic (Diana RossÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ eyes literally filling the screen during Ã¢â‚¬Å“Where Did Our Love GoÃ¢â‚¬Â) moments which have been oft-shot by everyone from Pennebaker to Scorcese since, but never truly duplicated. For what <em>TAMI</em> managed to mount and maintain all those years ago irrefutably remains the highest of bars for concert events, and films thereof, to reach even today. </p>
<p>It may, sorrowfully, have taken nearly half a century to make it into our homes, but this film has not returned anew one single frame, nor scream, too soon.</p>
<p>Trust me: </p>
<p>You have never seen, nor heard, ANYTHING quite like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpYIWThQbYU"><strong>this</strong></a> before&#8230;..</p>

<p>Ã¢â‚¬Å“No more Beatles! No more Stones! We just want the Viletones!Ã¢â‚¬Â went the cry of true teen angst Ã¢â‚¬Ëœround my Toronto neighborhood circa the Summer of Hate, 1977. And, memories of my favorite punk-rock combo from <a href="https://www.hamiltonspectator.com/video2/punkbook/"><strong>a misspent youth</strong></a> notwithstanding, I <em>do</em> find myself feeling very much the same these thirty-three-and-a-third revolutions later as <a href="https://musosguide.com/public_html/musos.wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Beatles_Stones.jpg"><strong>big Beatle box sets and Rolling Stone re-issues</strong></a> continue to dominate our collective, sonic rear-view.</p>
<p>Of course I can still thrill to a remastered (<a href="https://www.beatlesagain.com/images/sly_canada.jpg"><strong>mono!</strong></a>) Ã¢â‚¬Å“She Loves YouÃ¢â‚¬Â as much as the next boomer, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rqqaw9iN0Js"><strong>glimpsing Hendrix backstage</strong></a> inside that <em>Get Yer Ya-YaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s</em> anniversary bundle will always raise a grin or two. But surely, <em>surely</em> there must have been <em>something</em> going on during those scant weeks between 1963 and 1969 when Lennon, McCartney, Jagger and/or Richard compositions werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sitting atop the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hit parades.</p>
<p>Surely!</p>
<p>Well, finally, <em>someone</em> Ã¢â‚¬â€œ namely those utterly fab folk over at <a href="https://www.reelinintheyears.com/"><strong>ReelinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ In The Years</strong></a> Ã¢â‚¬â€œ have seen fit to shed light upon some of the <em>other</em> mop-tops whose sounds and styles filled our six-transistors and Sunday evening <a href="https://files.brandflakesforbreakfast.com/uploaded_images/Ed-Sullivan-esquire-798406.jpg"><strong>Ed Sullivan</strong></a> shows. Yes, the first four editions of whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s promised to be an entire <a href="https://www.reelinintheyears.com/images/britishinvasion_3.jpg"><strong><em>British Invasion</em> series</strong></a> of DVDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s are, you bet, here at last, spotlighting Dusty Springfield, HermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hermits, Gerry and the Pacemakers and the Small Faces.</p>
<p>And what audio/visual treats these discs are! Meticulously researched and packaged, expertly restored and annotated and whenever possible hosted by many of the actual participants themselves, the songs and stories flow in never less than quick, LOUD frenzies so perfectly reminiscent of those once-Swinging Sixties themselves.</p>
<p>So, wherever to start then? How about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrIWPjCk8Gw"><strong>Gerry Marsden fondly recalling</strong></a> the very birth of the Liverpool Sound in the kind of detailed Ã¢â‚¬â€œ sometimes most candidly so Ã¢â‚¬â€œ way no <em>Beatles Anthology</em> would ever dare to. Or a self-admittedly Ã¢â‚¬Å“numbÃ¢â‚¬Â <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0_hVwxkSs"><strong>Dusty Springfield </strong></a>deplaning into Australia only to be accused of being Ã¢â‚¬Å“kookyÃ¢â‚¬Â and a spokesperson for Ã¢â‚¬Å“the hippie philosophyÃ¢â‚¬Â? </p>
<p>Elsewhere, not at all coincidentally perhaps, we discover the hitherto-unknown connection between comedian/philosopher Lord BuckleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spiritual Nazz and the Small FacesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ritual Methedrine, plus learn that it was in fact Peter NooneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seemingly innocent rhythm section who schooled <a href="https://home.comcast.net/~steelbeard1/whoholidayinnmoonphoto.jpg"><strong>Keith Moon</strong></a> in the fine art of Holiday Inn Ã¢â‚¬Å“redecoratingÃ¢â‚¬Â: why, watch closely and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll even spot actual Super 8 footage of pool-side, long underwear-festooned Who/Hermits hi-jinks deep within the Bonus Footage!</p>
<p>Such meaty beaty Bacchanalian moments aside however, this is one <em>British Invasion</em> which truly concentrates, as all such documentaries should but seldom do, on the MUSIC. And there are literally <em>hours</em> of vintage performance clips filling these discs, immaculately reproduced and shown complete and uncut, with nary a single word of needless graphic or narration dubbed over the guitar solos for once. Plus, not just the usual stream of oft-recycled <em>Shindig</em> and Sullivan snips either: The producers have obviously gone to incredible lengths to scour the globe in search of seldom, if ever seen footage of, for example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TJm_Y1Muc"><strong>HermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hermits</strong></a> on Norwegian television or GerryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Pacemakers in LiverpoolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cavern shooting their very own <em>Ferry Cross The Mersey</em> (Ã¢â‚¬Â¦now, when does <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-d0xUXdzoY"><strong>THAT film</strong></a> finally appear on DVD?!!)</p>
<p>Interestingly though, from the wealth of treasures spread across these discs, I was most pleasantly shocked to witness <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9UujJO8Iw"><strong>downright incendiary footage</strong></a> of the Small FacesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Marquee Club debut, March of 1966. While for all the world looking, dressing, and acting like little more than a Cockney Monkees with cooler hair, trapped from the get-go inside these lads was apparently a solid, fighting-tough beat Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ soul combo whose only Caucasian rivals at the time would have been those Young Rascals themselves. Who knew? (and <em>then</em> stay closely tuned for an extensive <em>Colour Me Pop</em> performance of their masterwork <em>OgdenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Nut Gone Flake</em> complete with Ã¢â‚¬Å“HappinessÃ¢â‚¬Â <a href="https://www.knowledgerush.com/wiki_image/a/aa/Unwin-sm.jpg"><strong>Stanley Unwin</strong></a>Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s narration, I kid you not).</p>
<p>Ã¢â‚¬Å“None of us knew how good and how ahead of our time we were,Ã¢â‚¬Â Small Face Kenney Jones admits herein, and that statement could rightfully serve as the modus operandi behind this entire series. Because, you see, <em>The British Invasion</em>, for the very first time ever, delves so very deeply into the hitherto-unexplored Ã¢â‚¬Å“second tierÃ¢â‚¬Â of mid-Sixties U.K. talent, and in doing so paints most vividly an indelible picture of the eraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s myriad musical and social upheavals. And in a way you just wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get from <em>any</em> existing thumbnail study or PBS pledge special, needless to say. </p>
<p><em>Dusty Springfield: Once Upon a Time</em>, <em>HermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hermits: Listen People</em>, <em>Gerry and the Pacemakers: ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gonna Be All Right</em> and <em>Small Faces: All Or Nothing</em> are available separately or, even better, housed together with two and a half full hours of <em>additional</em> Bonus Disc interview and performance footage as a <a href="https://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R4mWIjyfL.jpg"><strong>five-DVD collectorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s set</strong></a>. Either way you take them, each deserve to be seen and heard repeatedly by any Merseybeating fan <em>or</em> serious student of rock Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll Ã¢â‚¬Â¦or even for someone who just needs to know the correct way to toss a cherry bomb down a Holiday Inn toilet.</p>
<p>ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s <em>all</em> <a href="https://www.reelinintheyears.com/britishinvasion/"><strong>here</strong></a>. </p>

<p>Still in a most list-ful mood, but <em>this</em> round-up certainly wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a very easy one to compile, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have everyone know. The pickinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s were extremely, uh, thin, to say the very least.</p>

<p>Despite an alarming amount of critical mass to (and <em>by</em>) the contrary, there truly was much, much more worth hearing this decade just past than those big Big Star, Beatle, Bob Dylan and even Neil Young box sets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.fab4collectibles.com/BeatlemaniaLpLabel.JPG" alt="" width="320" height="320" /></p>
<p>Being eight years old in the Toronto suburbs of 1963, I was at the perfect age Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and in the perfect place Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to, yes, Meet the Beatles. Because by the time Ã¢â‚¬Å“those four youngsters from LiverpoolÃ¢â‚¬Â hit <a href="https://files.myopera.com/VegaTheTerrible/albums/526443/Ed%20Sullivan.jpg"><em>the Ed Sullivan Show</em></a> on 9 February 64, my friends and I had already spent the past six months familiarizing ourselves with John, Paul, George and RingoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s initial A-sides via OntarioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mighty <a href="https://las-solanas.com/arsa/surveys_item.php?svid=7860"><strong>1050 CHUM-AM Radio</strong></a>. </p>
<p>In other words then, the British Beat had no reason to invade Canada. It was <em>invited</em>.  </p>
<p>Unlike with our big neighbors to the immediate south you see, each of the BeatlesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ earliest discs garnered automatic release on Capitol Records of Canada, beginning right at the beginning with <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/9fyO5G9vy2dv-dOanK7Atg"><strong>Ã¢â‚¬Å“Love Me DoÃ¢â‚¬Â</strong></a> in February of Ã¢â‚¬â„¢63 (the version with <em>Ringo</em> on drums, by the way!), and the Canadian Beatle Discography boasts many other rare slices of vintage vinyl totally unique to the genre, and as a result extremely collectable.</p>
<p>For example, the Canadian <a href="https://www.collectorsmusicreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/beatles-beatlemania.jpg"><strong><em>Beatlemania!</em></strong></a> album not only sported an identical cover and track line-up, but was released the very same week <em>With the Beatles</em> was in the UK (making it the first Beatle album released anywhere within North America), and its twelve-inch Capitol Canada follow-up, the <em>Twist and Shout</em> album Ã¢â‚¬â€œ # 1 on the Canadian charts for ten weeks in early Ã¢â‚¬â„¢64 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ was in fact <a href="https://991.com/newGallery/The-Beatles-Twist-And-Shout-427873.jpg"><strong>the very first Ã¢â‚¬Å“big recordÃ¢â‚¬Â I ever had the pleasure to have owned</strong></a>.</p>
<p>And what a remarkable record it was:  Fourteen action-packed tracks featuring all four Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“count Ã¢â‚¬ËœemÃ¢â‚¬Â! Ã¢â‚¬â€œ of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first UK 45 top-sides, plus a generous helping of Cavern-baked covers from their homeland debut album <em>Please Please Me</em>. Being too young then to know, and still too young to care if nary a Beatle wrote each and every note or lyric herein, Carole KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“ChainsÃ¢â‚¬Â stacked so easily around Len/MacÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s similarly George Harri-sung Ã¢â‚¬Å“Do You Want To Know A Secret,Ã¢â‚¬Â Bacharach and DavidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Baby, ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s YouÃ¢â‚¬Â seamlessly followed John and PaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“P.S. I Love YouÃ¢â‚¬Â on <em>T &amp; S</em> Side 2, and the magnificent Arthur AlexanderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Anna (Go to Him),Ã¢â‚¬Â which kicked off this entire collection, continues to this day to hold more than its own against <em>any</em> Beatle composition you or even I could mention.</p>
<p>And while LennonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wholly larynx-bursting Ã¢â‚¬Å“Twist and ShoutÃ¢â‚¬Â completed the first Beatle album in Great Britain, the ever-inventive Canadian Capitol chose to close its namesake long-player with none other than Ã¢â‚¬â€œ wait for it Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“She Loves You.Ã¢â‚¬Â Take <em>that</em>, <a href="https://www.esquire.com/cm/esquire/images/george-martin-061809-fb-10644645.jpg"><strong>Sir George Martin!</strong></a> (and tell <a href="https://peteadequate.podOmatic.com/entry/2007-01-05T22_21_44-08_00"><strong>Dave Dexter, Jr.</strong></a> the news.)  </p>
<p>Meanwhile in the seven-inch division, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Please Please MeÃ¢â‚¬Â actually hit the <a href="https://www.math.mcgill.ca/rags/music/cfgp.jpg"><strong>CFGP Top Forty</strong></a> in Grande Prairie, Alberta in April of Ã¢â‚¬â„¢63, while two of Capitol CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most unique couplings, Ã¢â‚¬Å“All My LovingÃ¢â‚¬Â/Ã¢â‚¬ÂThis BoyÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Roll Over BeethovenÃ¢â‚¬Â/Ã¢â‚¬ÂPlease Mister Postman,Ã¢â‚¬Â sold sufficient (smuggled) copies to reach even the <em>American</em> Hot One Hundred a year later. Also, the U.S. Tollie label Ã¢â‚¬Å“Twist and ShoutÃ¢â‚¬Â/Ã¢â‚¬ÂThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a PlaceÃ¢â‚¬Â 45, which soared to <a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JlyOA9at_H0/SSHLmLCmryI/AAAAAAAAB28/cKp6cxhmrhI/s1600-h/beatles.billboard%2520chart.jpg"><strong><em>Billboard</em> # 2</strong></a> in April of 1964, was an identically-formed Canadian Capitol Top Ten much, much earlier. </p>
<p>Plus, may I just add that every single one of the above-mentioned original deep-grooved, meticulously mastered <a href="https://www.beatlesvinyl.com/canada/ca_sally_l.jpg"><strong>Canadian (mono!) pressings</strong></a> put their <a href="https://www.bigozine2.com/MP309/BEAbaggy/BEAbaggyFr.jpg"><strong>U.S. counterparts </strong></a>Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not to mention even the latest CD incarnations, truth to tell Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to total, unequivocal sonic shame. Really!</p>
<p>The moral of this absolutely Fab story then? Good music IS good music, and shall forever remain so, regardless of the size, format, packaging, advertising budget or even country-of-origin of the item in hand. </p>
<p>And of course, <em>any</em> discussion of Lost Grooves that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t contain multiple uses of the word Ã¢â‚¬Å“BeatleÃ¢â‚¬Â is a discussion I just must immediately bow out from.</p>
<p>P.S., and in closing:  Is it only me, or is the <a href="https://www.jibboo.com/beatles/cartoon.htm"><strong>Beatles Rock Band animation</strong></a> a tad cheesier than even that of the old Beatles cartoon series? </p>

<p>Believe it or not, the very first &quot;real&quot; concert I was ever allowed to attend as a wee Canadian tyke was The Jimi Hendrix Experience at Toronto&#39;s <a href="https://www.canadiandesignresource.ca/officialgallery/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/maple-leaf-gardens-playing-card.jpg"><strong>Maple Leaf Gardens</strong></a>, May 3, 1969. Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨</p>
<p>I&#39;d already been a fervent fan for a couple of years, having spent most of my Grade 8 art class making swirly <a href="https://www.elvis.com.au/presley/jimi_hendrix.shtml"><strong>sketches</strong></a> of Jimi in charcoal. Plus the <em>Are You Experienced? </em>album was right up there Ã¢â‚¬â€œ <a href="https://i118.photobucket.com/albums/o93/Grapost/Jimi1.jpg"><strong>almost</strong></a> Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with <em>Monkees Headquarters</em> on my 1967 Most-Played List.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨</p>
<p>Fast-forwarding, Christmastime &#39;68 was spent, between runs down the local tobogganing hill, digging all eight vinyl sides of The White Album AND <a href="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2589/4090731136_8b649b05ea.jpg"><strong><em>Electric Ladyland</em></strong></a> and, most likely as a direct result, my gym-class rhythm section and I were just starting to assemble our very own semi-power trio when word filtered along the groupvine that the Experience were planning to stop by our very neighborhood in a few months as part of their possibly-Farewell World Tour.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨</p>
<p>In a word then? WOW.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨</p>
<p>My most-trusted pal Ric scored two tickets in the Gardens&#39; nosebleed section and I fibbed to my parents that we were off to a hootenanny (!) for the evening. Yet no sooner had we approached the venue that word began a&#39;buzzin&#39; that our hero had just been <a href="https://thumbs.imagekind.com/member/c537320e-fe74-442d-af91-e83744a6e366/uploadedartwork/650X650/3d186b24-809c-4019-85bb-47194052c036.jpg"><strong>busted</strong></a> for carrying a batch of non- pharmaceutical mood enhancers into Toronto Airport. HmmmÃ¢â‚¬Â¦</p>
<p>Undaunted, we climbed skyward to our seats, sat on sonic needles and pins-ah through both opening acts (the pretty cool <a href="https://www.metacafe.com/watch/yt-LRQRZeUMBd4/cat_mother_good_ol_rock_roll/"><strong>Cat Mother &amp; the All Night Newsboys</strong></a>, whose big hit &quot;Good Old Rock n Roll&quot; my little band was already struggling to learn, followed by none other than, uh, <a href="https://www.wtv-zone.com/ruexperienced/images/Noel_Redding2A.jpg"><strong>Fat Mattress</strong></a>) til the one and only Jimi Himself sauntered on stage, miraculously only a few minutes late.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨</p>
<p>Now considering all the man had already been through that day I guess it was no real surprise the evening&#39;s set consisted of mainly down-cast tunes a la &quot;Red House,&quot; though Jimi <em>did</em> graciously treat the teenage throng with a quick encore full of that fabled, fiery Foxey Purpleness of yore.</p>
<p>And then, suddenly, he was gone. Experience and all.</p>
<p>James Marshall Hendrix returned to town briefly that December however, just long enough to be completely exonerated of all narco-charges (&quot;Canada has just given me <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/the_first_rays/3375929130/"><strong>the greatest Christmas present ever!</strong></a>&quot; he exclaimed to the <em>Toronto Daily Star</em>), but I suppose one could question if, or why, that life lesson ultimately went <a href="https://www.rockmine.com/Hendrix/JimiCert.GIF"><strong>unheeded</strong></a>. And I suppose it does say something that out of all the delicately detailed minutiae forever etched upon my grey matter concerning that momentous concert forty long, long Toronto MayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ago, I can still most vividly recall EXACTLY <a href="https://www.beckersbakeryanddeli.com/images/Cakes/Jimi%20Hendrix.jpg"><strong>what Jimi was wearing</strong></a> (all Harlem-Asbury chic all the way!), what I was wearing even (<a href="https://www.clevelandseniors.com/images/cleveland/pigs/day-glo-pig.jpg"><strong>don&#39;t ask</strong></a>), the appropriately brilliant weather, the commuter train Ric and I snuck on after we told our parental units we&#39;d just be folking around &#8230;hell, I even remember the proto-Bowzer moves Cat Mother &amp; Co. deployed whilst performing their one hit wonder!Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨</p>
<p>But do I recall a single sliver of the sounds and/or <a href="https://www.atr-lang.com/data/media/1/rock&amp;roll_027_hendrix&amp;noel_redding.jpg"><strong>stylings</strong></a> of the Noel Redding-fronted Fat Mattress performance of that same, utterly magical night? No sir, I do not. Which reminds me: Mr. Redding himself <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/noel-redding-730294.html"><strong>passed onward</strong></a> and upward to that great big Gardens in the sky six years ago May 11th.</p>
<p>And the moral, perhaps, to this all? Well, I still find myself revisiting <em>Electric Ladyland</em> on almost as regular a basis as I do the MonkeesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ <em>Headquarters</em>. So you see some things, I guess, <a href="https://www.kruufm.com/files/23/JimiHendrix3.jpg"><strong>shall never change</strong></a>. </p>

<p>TEN REASONS WHY<br /><strong>BUDDY HOLLY</strong><br />STILL MATTERS</p>
<p> 1. THE CHIRPING CRICKETS<br />       Buddy Holly, alongside rhythm guitarist Niki Sullivan, bassist Joe B. Mauldin, and drummist-extraordinaire Jerry Allison, formed the immaculately suited, fully self-contained singing/songwriting <a href="https://www.rockabillyhall.com/buddycrickets1001.jpg"><strong>template</strong></a> upon which some of the greatest pop-rock bands since, from those Beatles most obviously on down, were inextricably linked at the hip.</p>
<p> 2. BUDDYÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S BUDDY<br />       When no less than that up-coming King of Western Bop Elvis Presley first blew into <a href="https://www.elvispresleymusic.com.au/pictures/img/elvis/50s/55/1955_june_3.jpg"><strong>Lubbock, Texas on tour in 1955</strong></a>, homeboy Buddy Holly was not only right there in the front row cheering him on, but afterwards appointed himself the Hillbilly CatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exclusive host, guide and confidant for the ensuing sixteen hours. Duly inspired, Buddy immediately revamped his burgeoning Crickets from an alt.-bluegrass combo into LubbockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very own Elvis, Scotty and Bill Ã¢â‚¬Â¦so successfully so, in fact, that several months later, when Elvis triumphantly returned to town, Buddy Holly had graduated from mere tour guide status to that of official <em>on</em>-stage opening act.</p>
<p> 3. LEARNING THE GAME<br />       After somehow failing to impress the usually infallible Owen Bradley with Ã¢â‚¬Å“ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Be The DayÃ¢â‚¬Â at a 1956 demo session (Ã¢â‚¬Å“the worst song I ever heardÃ¢â‚¬Â was his verdict), Buddy determinedly drove one thousand miles from Nashville to the Clovis, New Mexico studios of Norman Petty, where over the next eighteen months they turned <a href="https://reminiscinginclovis.blogspot.com/search/label/Main%20Studio"><strong>a simple two-track facility</strong></a> into an audio workshop/lab from which came not only the look and attitude, but the very <i>sounds</i> of the 1960Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s to come. Despite his so obviously prescient George Martin ways though, Petty must be docked serious points for screwing Buddy royally over songwriting credits, royalties, and even concert proceeds until the Holly estate could eventually be forever wrenched from his Machiavellian claws.  </p>
<p> 4. LISTEN TO ME           <br />      It may have lasted only twenty-five days, but when Buddy and his Crickets <a href="https://www.hood.de/img/full/1433/14336460.jpg"><strong>toured the United Kingdom</strong></a> in the spring of 1958, those watching closely and taking serious notes for future use were, amongst thousands of others, John Lennon and Paul McCartney (whose first-ever recording was a near note-perfect Ã¢â‚¬Å“ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Be The DayÃ¢â‚¬Â shortly afterwards), Mick Jagger and Keith Richards (the former already proud owner of <a href="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/40/75959031_7b502cf066.jpg?v=0"><strong>the <em>Chirping Crickets</em> album</strong></a>), Graham Nash and Allan Clarke (who soon grew their two-man Everlys act into the full, named-in-guess-whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s-honor Hollies), and pioneering British record producer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnvptR6mdYQ"><strong>Joe Meek</strong></a> Ã¢â‚¬Â¦who subsequently became so obsessed over Holly that he not only killed his landlady, but <em>himself</em> on the eighth anniversary of BuddyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own tragic demise.  </p>
<p> 5. NOT FADE AWAY<br />       It did indeed take a Buddy Holly composition to first put <a href="https://www.rollingstonesnet.com/images/NFA.gif"><strong>The Rolling Stones </strong></a>securely into the American hit parade with, at the very height of Beatlemania, Lennon/McCartneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Wanna Be Your ManÃ¢â‚¬Â unceremoniously relegated to the singleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s B-side! And speaking of whomÃ¢â‚¬Â¦</p>
<p> 6. WORDS OF LOVE<br />       Buddy wrote the best song on the <a href="https://www.fab4collectibles.com/BeatlesVIstereoRareLabelWC1.jpg"><strong><em>Beatles VI</em></strong></a> album; and, come to think of it, maybe even on <em>Beatles For Sale</em>.</p>
<p> 7. FOOLÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S PARADISE<br />       BuddyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wealth of songs have proven so adaptable, durable and downright sturdy as to withstand covers from the likes of Rush (who also debuted on seven-inch vinyl with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Not Fade AwayÃ¢â‚¬Â I kid you not), the Grateful Dead, The Knack and even Linda Ronstadt. Not to mention Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s So EasyÃ¢â‚¬Å“ (-Off oven cleaner) and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Oh BoyÃ¢â‚¬Â becoming Ã¢â‚¬Å“Oh, Buick!Ã¢â‚¬Â television jingles at the behest of HollyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s supposedly sympathetic post-Petty <a href="https://www.mplcommunications.com/home.asp"><strong>publishing magnate Sir Paul McC</strong></a>. Quite highly recommended nevertheless is the 1977 McCartney-produced <em>Holly Days</em>, um, tribute album by then-Wing Denny Laine. </p>
<p> 8. MAYBE BABY<br />       Years before he was to become the serial tragic clown of television reality programming, that perennially short-pant-legged dust storm known as Gary Busey deservedly nabbed an Oscar nomination for his title role in 1978Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sMFQySGHs8"><strong><em>Buddy Holly Story</em></strong></a>. Now while its script may have taken inexcusable Hollywood shortcuts in recounting our heroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and music, at least Gary, alongside co-stars Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith, became pretty damn garage-worthy Crickets  all over the filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soundtrack, performing as close to live whenever possible before the unforgiving cameras.</p>
<p> 9. CRYING, WAITING, HOPING<br />       Weeks before his last-ever tour, a newly married Holly sang several song sketches into a tape recorder in his Greenwich Village apartment for what turned out to be posterity. Having already hinted at still non-categorizable sounds-to-come with tracks like Ã¢â‚¬Å“EverydayÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“WellÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ All Right,Ã¢â‚¬Â <a href="https://homepage.ntlworld.com/p.moorcroft/Hollyville/Jpgs/tapereel.jpg"><strong>BuddyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last recordings</strong></a> leap even further into the unknown with covers of Ray Charles (!), Bing Crosby (!!), plus HollyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own final compositions. Exquisite guitar-and-voice-only recordings, they are far more than simply Ã¢â‚¬Å“unplugged.Ã¢â‚¬Â They are sublime, heartbreaking, and totally unique. As with most things Holly.    </p>
<p>10. STANDING IN THE DOORWAY<br />       &quot;And I just want to say that when I was sixteen or seventeen years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at Duluth National Guard Armory and I was three feet away from him. And he <em>looked</em> at me. And I just have some sort of feeling that he was &#8212; I don&#39;t know how or why &#8212; but I know he was with us all the time we were making this record in some kind of way.&quot;<br />      Ã¢â‚¬â€ <a href="https://www.bobdylanroots.com/holly.html"><strong>Bob Dylan</strong></a>, 1998 Grammy Awards acceptance speech for Album of the Year <em>Time Out Of Mind</em>.</p>

<p>Several weeks ago, a random gathering of some of the best musicians from CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest musical berg (thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s <a href="https://www.hamiltonpostcards.com/pages/industry.html"><strong>Hamilton, Ontario</strong></a>, by the way) threw themselves onstage as part of the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s annual Locke Street Festival. Spearheaded by the one and only <a href="https://www.tomwilson.net/"><strong>Tom Wilson</strong></a>, said ad-hoc combo was busy rocking and rolling things all the way up that street as the sun slid down when suddenly, a most familiar figure was spotted nearby. The lead singer of the one, the only, <a href="https://www.teenagehead.ca/"><strong>Teenage Head</strong></a>.</p>
<p>As would later be reported in the press, &quot;I asked Frankie, &#39;Frankie, fuck man, you&#39;ve got to come up here and sing,&#39;&quot; Wilson says. &quot;He said, &#39;You got to give me a hundred bucks.&#39; So I reached into my pocket and I only had fifty, so I asked <a href="https://www.dave-rave.com/"><strong>Dave Rave</strong></a> for the other half. I said, &#39;Dave, fifty bucks for Frankie.&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;And this was the kind of love they had for Frankie. Dave didn&#39;t ask me, &#39;What for? What does Frankie need fifty bucks for?&#39; He was just pulling it out of his pocket. And Frankie got up and did Ã¢â‚¬ËœLet&#39;s ShakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.&quot; </p>
<p>It turned out to be the last-ever public appearance of Frank Kerr, much better known Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and most rightfully so Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as Frankie Venom, who along with his high school pals about thirty-three years ago decided to form a band in between spins of Dolls, Stooges and, yes, FlaminÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Groovies records. Remarkably, that little band that could went on to garner two gold and one platinum twelve-inchers of their very own; in fact, their latest, now available from the fine folk over at <a href="https://www.sonicunyon.com/"><strong>Sonic Unyon Recordings</strong></a>, actually features <a href="https://img32.picoodle.com/img/img32/4/5/29/f_Untitled1m_327f762.jpg"><strong>Marky Ramone</strong></a> on the drums. Terrifically high praise indeed.</p>
<p>In a scar-studded career that admittedly held more bumps than most bandsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Teenage Head never turned (or toned) things down, never towed anyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s line, and never ever made a bad record or gave a bad show that I, or anyone else for that matter, should care to recall. And whether slithering across the heat pipes of TorontoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legendary Crash and Burn club, opening for the Pretenders, Talking Heads and Elvis Costello <a href="https://www.teenagehead.ca/blogs/news/uploaded_images/New-Image-722626.JPG"><strong>in front of fifty-thousand</strong></a> at CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Heatwave festival Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or belting Ã¢â‚¬ËœLetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ShakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ for and with some old friends on Locke Street on a warm late eve Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Frankie Venom was every single inch the Head above all others.  </p>
<p>He succumbed to throat cancer on October 15, 2008, aged fifty-two. Your record collection will never be the same. </p>
