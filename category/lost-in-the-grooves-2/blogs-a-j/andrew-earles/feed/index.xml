										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Like to read? Good. Enjoy this action-packed post/bulletin/irritant of Earles and Jensen news and fun facts!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">First, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OtE7qcemyg">hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a clip from the late-70Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s made-for-TV mess, <em>Death Drug</em></a>. It pays off in the end.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">NowÃ¢â‚¬Â¦</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">**Take a look at our revamped MySpace profile!! Listen to the posted track!! (If you are not receiving this info from our MySpace profile, go <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&#038;friendid=129385920">here</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kurt Loder Has Lost His MindÃ¢â‚¬Â will be on Disc 2 of <em>Earles and Jensen Present: Just Farr A Laugh Vol. 1 and 2</em>. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">What about those photos!?! We were afraid to post more, as those images will be part of the entire breathtaking package (see below), and we didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to be held accountable when peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brains began melting from their ears!! </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">**<a href="http://www.matadorrecords.com/matablog/?p=1026">Take a look at this link</a>!! Both of the photos, beautifully-taken by local Memphis photog Geoffrey Brent Shrewsbury, will appear in the <em>Earles and Jensen Present: Just Farr A Laugh Vol. 1 and </em>2 booklet. The ArbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s photo was taken a mere seconds before we were dismissed from the premises. No shirt, no shoes, NO PROBLEM!! The golfing photo session was a little more laid back. I (Earles) had to train the 14-year-old kid on how to hold a cigarette in oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mouth. We were going for sort of a Caddyshack Ã¢â‚¬Å“bad caddyÃ¢â‚¬Â thing. If any reader can come forward with a story about a neÃ¢â‚¬â„¢er-do-well teenage caddy that listened (or listens) to <a href="http://wc07.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&#038;sql=11:kifuxqe5ldse~T1">Killdozer</a>, well, I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really promise anything, so never mind. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Me: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Do you smoke? Have you ever smoked a cigarette?Ã¢â‚¬Â</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Teen made to wear Killdozer t-shirt: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Of course not.Ã¢â‚¬Â</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Further info:Ã‚Â <em><br /></em></font></font><em><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ã‚Â </font></em><em> </em></p>
<p><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Earles and Jensen Present: Just Farr A Laugh Vol. 1 and 2</em> will be released February 19<sup>th</sup> on Matador Records. It will be a double CD set of what currently constitutes the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest collection of prank phone calls. Included in the package will be a book (not <em>booklet)</em> of drawings, photographs, and writing, all courtesy of multiple contributors.Ã‚Â  </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Bleachy, absurd celebrity impersonations, pop-cultural clusterf**ks, total insanity Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the whole gang is hereÃ¢â‚¬Â¦a 150 minute assault on your funny bone. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Think about Fleetwood MacÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s <em>Tusk</em>, YesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ <em>Tales from Topographic Oceans</em>, the Hampton Grease BandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s <em>Music To Eat</em>, The Mothers of InventionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s <em>Freak Out</em>, Husker DuÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s <em>Zen Arcade</em>, the MinutemenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s <em>Double Nickels on the Dime</em>, TFUL 282Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s <em>Mother of All Saints</em>, Ross McElweeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s <em>ShermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s March</em>, and imagine if there was a prank call/comedy version of these wonderfully indulgent, macro masterpieces. This will become a reality on February 19th, 2008.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A short list of artists that contributed drawings: Mike Aho, Archer Prewitt, Devendra Banhardt, Mark Henning, Ian Marshall, Gavin McInnes, Jake Oas, Aurel Schmidt, Matt Sweeney, and Megan Whitmarsh.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know Ã¢â‚¬Ëœem? Look Ã¢â‚¬Ëœem up. Some of these people can be found on the Internet. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">When an early version of this press release was circulated on Mr. EarlesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ blog (</font><a href="http://www.failedpilot.com/"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">www.failedpilot.com</font></a><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">), a reader commented that (grammatical errors left intact) Ã¢â‚¬Å“this thing sounds weirdly artsy for a comedy albumÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ its weird how comedy ceedees are now adopting obtuse inde rock artwork. imagine if richard pryor albums had, like, a blurry pile of leaves on it. am i right?Ã¢â‚¬Â </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">No sir, you are wrong. No square centimeter of the physical package or split second of the recorded works resembles anything that could be considered Ã¢â‚¬Å“abstract.Ã¢â‚¬Â WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re talking pure entertainment from point A to point Z, people. <em>Earles and Jensen Present: Just Farr A Laugh Vol 1. and 2 </em>will not enter your as a box full of useless cardboard, printed with neon scribbles in the name of Ã¢â‚¬Å“art.Ã¢â‚¬Â </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The entire list of writers that contributed forewords is as follows: Gregg Turkington (AKA Neil Hamburger, comedy genius, writer, <em>Warm Voices Rearranged</em>), Matador co-owner/co-founder Gerard Cosloy, David Dunlap Jr. (writer, <em>Washington City Paper</em>, <em>Memphis Flyer</em>, funny guy), and master humorist/writer Neil Pollack (books: <em>Alternadad</em>, <em>The Neal Pollack Anthology of American Literature</em>, <em>Never Mind The Pollacks: A Rock and Roll Novel, </em>editor/contributor: AkashicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s <em>Chicago Noir</em>). </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">All of the must-be-seen-to-be-believed photography is by Geoffrey Brent Shrewsbury. Seriously, it will blow your mind. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Otherwise, the respective introductions and thousands upon thousands of words of track-by-track commentary are provided by Andrew Earles and Jeffrey Jensen. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Who you are dealing with:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Along with writer Ian Christe and artist Steve Keene, Jeffrey Jensen founded modern day Brooklyn NYC around 1992, during the Dinkins administration. In March of 2007, he traversed Europe confounding the Arctic Monkeys (and their simpleminded fans) as Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Mooch,Ã¢â‚¬Â the funniest character to ever grace the world of YouTube. The uninitiated can be floored by combining Ã¢â‚¬Å“The MoochÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Arctic MonkeysÃ¢â‚¬Â in the siteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s search engine. An accomplished artist, Jeff is known for his puppet shows, intricate nightlight dioramas, and evenings of vast entertainment, as well as anything else you could possibly think of. With his incredibly magnetic personality, Mr. Jensen has left a lasting mental imprint on anyone that has spent over an hour in his presence. Jeffrey has played in many bands, including The Closet Case, The Jewish, and The Star Spangles. Earlier in this career, he served as the bass player for Homestead recording artists Smack Dab, a band that keeps some seats warm in the cutout bin. He drives a 1982 Chrysler Lebaron, contributes regularly to<em> Vice Magazine</em>, and was accidentally shot with a .22 rifle when he was 13-years-old. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Andrew Earles is a writer and loosely-defined humorist based in Memphis, TN. His words regularly appear in <em>The Onion A/V Club, Spin, Harp, Paste, Magnet, Vice, Paste, Chunklet,</em> and <em>The Memphis Flyer</em>Ã¢â‚¬Â¦among others. He founded <em>The Cimarron Weekend</em> in 1997, co-publishing and co-editing said argument-starter with David Dunlap Jr. until 2001. Four or five people like to claim that it was a great zine. From 2001 until late 2006, Andrew was a regular contributor to Tom ScharplingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s <em>The Best Show on WFMU</em>. As far as books go, his essays have appeared in the now out-of-print <em>Lost In The Grooves</em> (Routledge) and remainder table favorite, <em>The Overrated Book</em> (Last Gasp). He is a core contributor to <em>The Rock Bible</em>, to be published by Quirk in 2008. Most of his attempts at live comedy have failed miserably. Andrew is a proud Southerner and amateur, wanna-be outdoorsman that loves to fish, act like he knows a lot about animals, and walk around in the woods. He sometimes has a smart mouth, yet against all logic, has yet to receive that long-overdue ass-whomping (not an invitation). This is his blog: </font><a href="http://www.failedpilot.com/"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">www.failedpilot.com</font></a></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Jeffrey Joe Jensen and Andrew Scott Earles are LeoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, reliably carrying all of the negative and positive baggage of that particular sign. Amazingly, and unknown to the duo until several years ago, they share the exact same birthday of August 15<sup>th</sup>. </font></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To detour from self-promotion, pop-cultural alienation,Ã‚Â and failedÃ‚Â stabs at humor, it must be noted that I am amazed daily that one of my cats is about to turn thirteen.Ã‚Â This will beÃ‚Â simpleÃ¢â‚¬Â¦the sort of thingÃ‚Â one might read on an Elliot Smith fanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blog.</p>
<p>This (once) solid black, longhaired, somewhat overweightÃ‚Â and big-boned (heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s aÃ‚Â BIG cat) asshole makes a frequent habit ofÃ‚Â vomitingÃ‚Â hairballsÃ‚Â onto my bed, records, and books. His hair is turning a combination of black, gray, and maroon.Ã‚Â TheÃ‚Â name I gave this animalÃ‚Â is Ã¢â‚¬Å“Marcel.Ã¢â‚¬Â It means nothing. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s smart, one of those Ã¢â‚¬Å“like a dogÃ¢â‚¬Â cats, which is good, as I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like dogs. Cats are the thinking manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pet. Dogs are a complete hassle.</p>
<p>One of MarcelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s asshole moves went like this:</p>
<p>One night, I returned home from a long evening of drinking to find one of MarcelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bottom fangs protruding from his mouth at a right angle. Suffering from a fairly serious abscess, Marcel was rushed to the vetÃ‚Â during the next dayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mind-shattering hangoverÃ‚Â (not much you can do about this at four in the morning). OneÃ‚Â confusing, blurry dayÃ‚Â and $600 later, Marcel was returnedÃ‚Â home minus his two bottom grabbers (one had simply fallen out earlier that yearÃ¢â‚¬Â¦I found it on the floor).</p>
<p>Several years prior, Marcel was prancing around on my balcony and fell fourteen feet, belly-floppingÃ‚Â a concrete flowerbed border. He cracked two ribs and shredded his front claws inÃ‚Â the failed attempt to regain purchase before the fall. Needless to say, it was soft food for a month. PRESCRIPTION soft food. Familiar with the racket that is prescription pet food? LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hope not.</p>
<p>At times, considering some of the healthy gifts that Marcel leaves in the litter box, I hallucinate that I own a giraffe. Either that or a large man is sneaking into my home to use my catÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s toilet. I like to confront Marcel while heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s doing the business. Yelling Ã¢â‚¬Å“BAD CATÃ¢â‚¬Â usually does wonders for his little walnut brain.</p>
<p>Marcel gets along fine with his adopted sister, a very fat (18 &#8211; 19 pounds) orange tabby named Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Mayor.Ã¢â‚¬Â I absorbedÃ‚Â The MayorÃ‚Â into the foldÃ‚Â during the summer of 1998, thus replacing her predecessor, a fascinating cat named Ã¢â‚¬Å“Colby.Ã¢â‚¬Â Colby could fetch and hadÃ‚Â bi-coloredÃ‚Â fur. Each hair started out white, and turned black, giving her the look of a cuddly ashtray.Ã‚Â Sadly, Colby died of kidney failure after months of incredibly stressful treatment. The Mayor has a tiny frame. Her obesity makesÃ‚Â it appear as though she swallowed a grapefruit.Ã‚Â The other cat in the house, my girlfriendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beautiful calico that owned theÃ‚Â premises before I moved in, is another story. Marcel emotionallyÃ‚Â and physically terrorizesÃ‚Â this cat on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Aside from my mom and fewer than four others, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve kept a longer relationship with Marcel than any other warm-blooded creature.</p>
<p>This is not an obit, nor is Marcel ill. If anything,Ã‚Â he is a little too healthy for a 13-year-old cat, but if he continues to rob me of a good nightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sleep (hairball barfing, furniture destruction, needless howling at all hours), there will be issues that require tissues.</p>
<p>Yeah, right. Marcel is untouchable. You can view Marcel and my two lesser cats by visiting my MySpace profile. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to find that on your own. Dig around forÃ‚Â a picture of me with a horrible haircut, Ã¢â‚¬Å“workingÃ¢â‚¬Â in bed.</p>
<p>HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to you, Marcel, mayÃ‚Â there beÃ‚Â many more years in our love/hate relationship.</p>
<p>See, I told you.</p>
<p>Ã‚Â </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>1. Anton choking on the peanuts during the Ã¢â‚¬Å“so, you married into itÃ¢â‚¬Â exchange.</p>
<p>2. Tasteful use of the transponder.</p>
<p>3. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not near as violent as the reviewers, especially the ninnie that wrote about it for Slate, would have you believe.</p>
<p>4. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a tour of proto-sprawl motels circa-1980.</p>
<p>5. (Goof) Mid-80Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s K-Car in motel parking lot.</p>
<p>6. This poorly-written volunteer entry in the Ã¢â‚¬ËœParentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s GuideÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ section of the filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s IMDB entry:</p>
<p id="swiki.2.2.1"><em>Strong, graphic, grim violence throughout. It has a longer-lasting effect than a normal R-rated movie. It is the most violent movie that the Coen Brothers have done yet. A man uses a cattle gun to shoot his victims (a few at point blank). These shootings (there are many) are quite graphic and bloody. A man gets strangled with handcuffs (blood spurts as an artery bursts). A man comes across many dead bodies (and a dead dog). These dead bodies are shown graphically. A man shoots a dog thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attacking him. A man gets shot at (he gets hit in the arm). A man is in a car crash and a bone is sticking out of his arm. A man is shot in the head and neck, blood pours out. This happens during a shootout. A man is shot in his side, but gets into a hospital. It is implied that a completely innocent woman gets shot. A man shoots an antelope while hunting, and the antelope limps away. The list goes onÃ¢â‚¬â€œviolence is one of the movieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s main themes. </em></p>
<p>7. It is indeed the Coen BrothersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ return to glory.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Though other outlets, probably Pitchfork and definitely the Matador Records web site, will be announcing this over the next week and a half, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m here to break the news that Andrew Earles and Jeffrey Jensen have finally signed to Matador Records, under the artist moniker, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Earles and Jensen.Ã¢â‚¬Â </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">What this means:</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Earles and Jensen Present: Just Farr A Laugh Vol. 1 and 2</em> will be released February 19<sup>th</sup> on Matador Records. It will be the first comedy release for the legendary indie label; aÃ‚Â past and current home to Cat Power, Yo La Tengo, Pavement, The Ponys, Interpol, The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Mission of Burma, and The Unsane. The double CD set constitutes the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest collection of prank phone calls. Included in the package will be a book (not <em>booklet)</em> of drawings, photographs, and writing, all courtesy of multiple contributors. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a virtual whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s who that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make a lot of sense, but nonetheless creates a wonderful companion to the recorded works. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Bleachy, absurd celebrity impersonations, pop-cultural clusterf**ks, total insanity Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the whole gang is hereÃ¢â‚¬Â¦a 150-minute assault on your funny bone. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">If you are a fan of Fleetwood MacÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s <em>Tusk</em>, YesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ <em>Tales from Topographic Oceans</em>, the Hampton Grease BandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s <em>Music To Eat</em>, The Mothers of InventionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s <em>Freak Out</em>, Husker DuÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s <em>Zen Arcade</em>, the MinutemenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s <em>Double Nickels on the Dime</em>, TFUL 282Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s <em>Mother of All Saints</em>, and wish there was a prank call/comedy version of these wonderfully indulgent, macro masterpieces, well, it looks like February 19<sup>th</sup> is going to be your lucky day. That last sentence is a thinly-veiled way to say that unless you are promotionally serviced by Matador Records or rank amongst the contributors, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expect a burn or freebie. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A short list of artists that contributed drawings: Mike Aho, Archer Prewitt, Devendra Banhart, Mark Henning, Ian Marshall, Gavin McInnes, Jake Oas, Aurel Schmidt, Matt Sweeney, and Megan Whitmarsh.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know Ã¢â‚¬Ëœem? Look Ã¢â‚¬Ëœem up. Some of these people can be found on the Internet. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The entire list of writers that contributed forewords: Gregg Turkington (AKA Neil Hamburger, comedy genius, writer, <em>Warm Voices Rearranged</em>), Matador co-owner/co-founder Gerard Cosloy, David Dunlap Jr. (writer, <em>Washington City Paper</em>, <em>Memphis Flyer</em>, funny guy), and master humorist/writer Neil Pollack (books: <em>Alternadad</em>, <em>The Neal Pollack Anthology of American Literature</em>, <em>Never Mind The Pollacks: A Rock and Roll Novel, </em>editor/contributor: AkashicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s <em>Chicago Noir</em>). </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">All of the must-be-seen-to-be-believed photography is by Geoffrey Brent Shrewsbury. Seriously, it will blow your mind. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Otherwise, the respective introductions and thousands upon thousands of words of track-by-track commentary are provided by Andrew Earles and Jeffrey Jensen. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Who you are dealing with:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Along with writer Ian Christe and artist Steve Keene, Jeffrey Jensen founded modern day Brooklyn NYC around 1992, during the Dinkins administration. He has written or directedÃ‚Â the films <em>The Low Down Dirty D.A.W.G.S.</em> (1999), <em>Street Boogie</em> (2001, shelved), and <em>Graceland Too: The Movie</em> (still in production). An accomplished artist, Jeff is known for his puppet shows, intricate nightlight dioramas, and evenings of vast entertainment, as well as anything else you could possibly think of. With his incredibly magnetic personality, Mr. Jensen has left a lasting mental imprint on anyoneÃ‚Â lucky enough to have spentÃ‚Â over an hour in his presence. Jeffrey has played in many bands, including The Closet Case, The Jewish, The Star Spangles, plus he was the bass player for Homestead Records recording artists Smack Dab. He drives a 1982 Chrysler Lebaron, contributes regularly to<em> Vice Magazine</em>, and was accidentally shot with a .22 rifle when he was 13-years-old. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Andrew Earles is a writer and loosely-defined humorist that lives in Memphis, TN. His words regularly appear in <em>The Onion A/V Club, Spin, Harp, Paste, Magnet, Vice, Paste, Chunklet,</em> and <em>The Memphis Flyer</em>Ã¢â‚¬Â¦among others. He founded <em>The Cimarron Weekend</em> in 1997, co-publishing and co-editing said argument-starter with David Dunlap Jr. until 2001. Four or five people like to claim that it was a great zine. From 2001 until late 2006, Andrew was a regular contributor to Tom ScharplingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s <em>The Best Show on WFMU</em>. As far as books go, his essays have appeared in the now out-of-print <em>Lost In The Grooves</em> (Routledge) and remainder table favorite, <em>The Overrated Book</em> (Last Gasp). He is a core contributor to <em>The Rock Bible</em>, to be published by Quirk in 2008. Most of his attempts at live comedy have failed miserably. Andrew is a proud Southerner and amateur, wanna-be outdoorsman that loves to fish, act like he knows a lot about animals, and walk around in the woods. He sometimes has a smart mouth, yet against all logic, has yet to receive that long-overdue ass-whomping (not an invitation). This is his blog: </font><a href="http://www.failedpilot.com/"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">www.failedpilot.com</font></a></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Jeffrey Joe Jensen and Andrew Scott Earles are LeoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, reliably carrying all of the negative and positive baggage of that particular sign. Amazingly, and unknown to the duo until several years ago, they share the exact same birthday of August 15<sup>th</sup>. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>I started writing this column in early 2003, making this the fourth year-end installment of WhereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Street Team?. Nobody celebrates four years of anything, unless itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sobriety, marriage or a killing spree. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not my point to recall the anniversary theme of last issueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s column; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s my point to state that coming up with a theme inside of a theme for the fourth time can be a little tough. So, with that on the table, I really have no idea what I was thinking when making the following assemblage, other than the fact that all of it happened in 2007. Oh, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve just come to the realization that this intro would have been best saved for the next year-end issue. People actually do seem to make note when things happen perpetually for five years. Happy Holidays. </em><strong>(THIS INTRO DOESNÃ¢â‚¬â„¢T REALLY ADD ANYTHING TO THE PIECEÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ JUST KINDA SPINS ITS WHEELS. WOULD BE BETTER IF IT JUST TOUCHED ON SOME TOPICS BRIEFLY AND MADE SOME QUICK JOKES INSTEAD OF BEING SELF-REFERENTIAL.)<br /></strong></font></font><strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ã‚Â </font></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now, what in the hell possessed me to On-Demand <em>The Reaping</em>? Was it a desire to watch Stringer Bell in his biggest movie roll yet? It certainly wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t my desire to absorb any Biblical horror. Biblical horror and zombie films: Two sub-genres that donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really do it for me. Yawn.</p>
<p>I did have a thought today. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to see Cormac McCarthyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (and now, the Coen BrothersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) Anton Chigurh tracking down Miranda July through the Pacific Northwest, storming through coffee shops, art galleries, and Whole Foods locations, offing all of her collaborators and colleagues with suppressed shotguns and a pneumatic cattle punch until the absurd, bloody finale.</p>
