I&#8217;ve been caught in recycling my own previous writing &amp; generally doing such a half-assed rush job with this blog that I figured I&#8217;d hang it up. I don&#8217;t have the time to do it the sort of justice I&#8217;d like, standards being low as they are. I also may have posted every obscuro song I <em>really</em> wanted you to hear, as well &#8211; but if you haven&#8217;t perused our archives, start with the <a href="https://detailedtwang.blogspot.com/2007/01/two-transatlantic-cuties.html">January 27th, 2007 post</a> &#8211; almost everything after that contains a song you should probably right-click on. Those won&#8217;t be up forever, so you might want to do that pretty soon.</p>
<div></div>
<p></p>
<div>In the meantime, I did another music-based blog called <a href="https://agonyshorthand.blogspot.com/">AGONY SHORTHAND</a> from 2003 to 2006 that&#8217;s got everything I wrote still up &amp; online. Check it out &#8211; it&#8217;ll take some time to digest all the not-enough-to-do-at-work mania. I still get all judgemental &amp; excited about craft beer over at <a href="https://hedonistbeerjive.blogspot.com/">HEDONIST BEER JIVE</a> too, and that shows no signs of abating any time soon. Thanks for reading &#8211; the links on the right over here&#8217;ll take you to even better places.</div>

They arrived in 1986-87 at the height of indie rockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fascination with noise, Ã¢â‚¬Å“scumrockÃ¢â‚¬Â and SST/Homestead/Touch &amp; Go heavy punk rock. Somehow this roots-reverent band was quickly grasped to the bosom of budding &#8211; mostly east coast &#8211; scenesters , likely due to their &#8217;86 debut 7Ã¢â‚¬Â EP<strong> Ã¢â‚¬Å“KeepersÃ¢â‚¬Â</strong>, which weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re posting for you today, and their &#8217;87 LP <strong>Ã¢â‚¬Å“Big Pine BoogieÃ¢â‚¬Â</strong>Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s (<em>which is pictured here</em>) loose-limbed Cramps-style primitivism and heavily reverbed, cranked-up guitars. The records have been seemingly lost to time, and criminally remain out of print and unavailable on CD. Their sound had a fantastic front porch feel to it, like no oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s taking the whole thing particularly seriously, and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a big bucket of beers beckoning nearby for consumption when the setÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wrapped up. Guitarists Don Howland, Jeff Evans and Dan Dow and drummer Ellen Hoover took their cues from the pantheon of rough-hewn American genius, from shambling Bo Diddley thumping, deep-South country a la Charlie Feathers, and pre-WWII delta blues giants like Skip James and Charley Patton. Trouser Press generously called it Ã¢â‚¬Å“intentional amateurismÃ¢â‚¬Â, which perhaps bestows musical abilities on the band they hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t yet earned. But you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care.</p>

But get this Ã¢â‚¬â€œ <em>they were girls</em>. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that whole forgotten underbelly of all-girl or girl-led bands from 1964-67, celebrated on the <strong>GIRLS IN THE GARAGE</strong> compilations and perhaps best known and represented by the single track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“What A Way To DieÃ¢â‚¬Â, by Leather TuscaderoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s <strong>PLEASURE SEEKERS</strong>. A few years ago I got wind of a couple of fantastic lost 45s by this Minnesota band, one of which had thankfully been repressed by Get Hip records. The other tracks are scattered among various hard-to-find compilation LPs and CDs. The Co-Ets have a really great, brooding, minor-key chug to their songs, with terrific young-girl vocals and choruses that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to excavate from your head once they get lodged in there. My favorite 2 of their 4 are the ones IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m posting for you here.</p>

I think IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m most taken with the squeaky keyboards and the strident, hectoring vocals that still sound smooth and comforting. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d follow these guys into the trenches, wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you? Many did, and left a pretty impressive legacy in &amp; around the UK around this era.</p>

Number one for me was (<em>and remains</em>) <strong>PERE UBUÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s</strong> Ã¢â‚¬Å“Heart of Darkness / Thirty Seconds Over TokyoÃ¢â‚¬Â; number two was (<em>and remains</em>) the <strong>ELECTRIC EELSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢</strong> Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cyclotron / AgitatedÃ¢â‚¬Â; after that I forget. Having only heard of the Desperate Bicycles in passing within the pages of Forced Exposure magazine, all I knew was that they were punk-era progenitors of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“D.I.Y.Ã¢â‚¬Â aesthetic, that they were excellent, and that their singles were impossibly rare. Certainly their first two 45s, now that I know &amp; love them, would have bumped a couple of ringers off the list if I were to do it again today.</p>
<p><strong>Ã¢â‚¬Å“Smokescreen / HandlebarsÃ¢â‚¬Â</strong> came out in 1977, with both songs on one side. I have a very clued-in pal who told me heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d never heard the band before, and that made me realize that I might have an opportunity to blow at least <em>one</em> mind by putting them up on Detailed Twang. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really have a ton to add about the band that hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been already written about <a href="https://www.topplers.net/others/desperate-bicycles.html">here</a>, <a href="https://www.furious.com/PERFECT/scritti.html">here </a>and <a href="https://www.headheritage.co.uk/unsung/review/309">here</a>, but let me add my voice to chorus calling these masterpieces among the most invigorating &amp; exciting rock and roll records of all time. The second 45 is even better, and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also coming to a computer screen near you soon.</p>

Fabienne herself has a new solo record out now, her second, called <a href="https://www.damagedgoods.co.uk/cgi-bin/miva?dama/merchant.mv+Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=1&amp;Product_Code=DAMGOOD286CD&amp;Category_Code=FABI">Ã¢â‚¬Å“BETWEEN YOU AND MEÃ¢â‚¬Â</a>. This French-native English lass skirts the brassy 60s pop of her homeland, and marries it to raw surfbeat, stomping garage rock of a decidedly Ã¢â‚¬Å“MerseyÃ¢â‚¬Â bent, and full-blown sugartown pop music. This latest record is better than her very solid solo debut, <a href="https://www.damagedgoods.co.uk/cgi-bin/miva?dama/merchant.mv+Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=1&amp;Product_Code=DAMGOOD221CD&amp;Category_Code=FABI">Ã¢â‚¬Å“NO TIME FOR SORROWSÃ¢â‚¬Â</a>, and is probably as good as her <strong>BRISTOLS</strong> material (which is fantastic Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all of it Ã¢â‚¬â€œ <a href="https://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/7260513/a/Best+Of+Fabienne+Delsol+And+The+Bristols.htm">start with the new greatest-hits collection</a>). I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to get back to ya. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m crossing my digits for a US tour to see if what goes on in the studio will translate to a live stage, but after seeing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvGZprf4E3I">Bristols clips on You Tube</a>, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m fairly certain that it will. Let me know what you think!</p>

When evidence finally surfaced in 1990 that confirmed said rumors, there was dancing in the hovels and houses of dozens record dorks countrywide, mine included. Salvo #1 was a sole track on a four-song compilation EP on Estrus Records called <strong>Ã¢â‚¬Å“TALES FROM ESTRUS</strong>Ã¢â‚¬Â. The comp actually led off with <strong>THE NIGHT KINGSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢</strong> Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dirty WorkÃ¢â‚¬Â, and it was a glorious thing. Ninety seconds of crunch that brings forth Link WrayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pencil-poked amps as played through by a ham-handed <strong>SONICS</strong>. And that voice Ã¢â‚¬â€œ man, what a howler. Vasquez was back.</p>
<p>Salvo #2, maybe half a year later, was a split single with a short-lived (<em>mercifully</em>) Seattle band called <strong>YUMMY</strong>. The Night KingsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ side was called Ã¢â‚¬Å“BugweedÃ¢â‚¬Â, and it practically blew the grooves off the vinyl. Loud, overloaded, garage scorch with no precedent and no antecedent Ã¢â‚¬â€œ something pure &amp; unique and totally wild. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m posting both tracks for you today. Soon the Night Kings would release an In The Red 45, a Sub Pop 45, some comp stuff and a full-blown LP. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what they started blowing minds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://detailedtwang.blogspot.com/2007/04/2-incredible-venom-p-stinger-clips.html"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5121723499992862242" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="https://bp1.blogger.com/_VsOOFXOWIvk/RxQEYx7YTiI/AAAAAAAAAzM/6ByFKOaoM5I/s320/032183.jpg" border="0" />VENOM P. STINGER</a> were an overpowering late 80s/early 90s Australian group who morphed out of one scorched-earth, rawer-than-raw hardcore noise band called <strong>THE SICK THINGS</strong>, and later again morphed into another thing completely: the lovely, edgy instrumental trio <strong>THE DIRTY THREE</strong>. In between were several LPs, a 45 and one 4-song CD-EP that it is essential that you hear. Nowhere have I heard a band so desperately trapped in their own skin. Their militaristic, brutally loud and often atonal punk rock was an ugly cousin to a lot of the American bands of the day, the ones that came out on labels like Amphetamine Reptile, Treehouse, Noiseville, Circuit and Adult Contemporary. Their singer, <strong>Dugald McKenzie</strong>, had the rawest mouth-rasp vocals imaginable, and not only was it difficult to imagine him singing without his neck veins popping halfway to China, it was difficult to hear his deep-accented wails and think him anything but <em>Australian</em>. Drummer <strong>Jim White</strong> usually sounded like he was stuck somewhere between drumming for the Daughters of the American Revolution parade and for later-period John Coltrane. Even when the songs didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fall together all that well Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and their albums do have some filler Ã¢â‚¬â€œ they never wavered from a mood that was dark, angry and ballistic. Even on the (rare) slow ones.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I was a pretty big fan while they were around, and I bought all the records where I could. I got to see them live twice, but without McKenzie, who was held back at customs &amp; which then necessitated the quick recruitment of Venom P. StingerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“biggest fanÃ¢â‚¬Â into vocal duties. (Or so says informed commenter KI <a href="https://detailedtwang.blogspot.com/2007/04/2-incredible-venom-p-stinger-clips.html">in the comments to this post</a>). Other than their one and only 45, Ã¢â‚¬Å“<strong>Walking About/25 Milligrams</strong>Ã¢â‚¬Â, their best record is this 1991 EP that came out on CD only called Ã¢â‚¬Å“<a href="https://www.hemisphere.nl/voorraad/Venom%20P%20%20Stinger%20Waiting%20room%20CD.htm">Waiting Room</a>Ã¢â‚¬Â. Play it, download it, and raise a pint of bitter for the now-deceased Dugald McKenzie, one of the great throat-rippers of all time.<br /><strong><br />Play or Download</strong> <a href="https://www.box.net/shared/sf8u426tyr">VENOM P.

They were perhaps the first speed/thrash/burn punk band that ever connected with me during my teenage late-night listening sessions with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Maximum Rock and Roll RadioÃ¢â‚¬Â, even before <strong>Black Flag</strong> or <strong>Minor Threat</strong>. Generic-by-the-numbers early 80s LA hardcore, with the added curveball of female singer Ã¢â‚¬Å“JulieÃ¢â‚¬Â, <strong>SIN 34</strong> at times had this ability to leapfrog the genre &amp; throw in some burning, stop-start hooks that got testosterone-fueled limbs flailing and bodies flying. I know that their name made it to Pee-Chees and Army surplus jackets even at my <em>Northern</em> California high school Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but then again, so did Ã¢â‚¬Å“China WhiteÃ¢â‚¬Â, Ã¢â‚¬Å“TSOLÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“The AdictsÃ¢â‚¬Â. In SoCal, they had a much higher profile, due to band member Dave MarkeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s involvement with <a href="https://www.wegotpowerfilms.com/wgp_magazine/wegotpowermag4cover.htm">WE GOT POWER</a> fanzine and friendly connections with <a href="https://detailedtwang.blogspot.com/2007/04/red-cross-born-innocent-demo-tapes.html">RED CROSS</a> and Smoke Seven records. Only one 7Ã¢â‚¬ÂEP and one (quite lame, save for 3-4 tracks) LP made it out, but IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve cherry-picked the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s winners for you.

C.O.T.B. did not let me down; on the contrary, this EP is full of frothing, electronics-filled no wave guitar, some absolutely thumping drumming, and enough bleeding ear tones to keep you in the isolation chamber for hours afterward. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a rabid, mysterious churner at the end of Side 1 called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Too Many MinistersÃ¢â‚¬Â that I have <em>not</em> been able to stop playing for a year. They put out one other 45 thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also quite good, and I think theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve maybe played one live show in the past 365 days.
