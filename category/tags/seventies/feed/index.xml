Also, over 170 Blue Ash songs that were found in the vaults a few years ago will also be available for the first time anywhere. Some of the titles are &quot;Walls&quot;, &quot;I&#8217;ll Be Standing By&quot;, &quot;Dinner At Mr. Billy&#8217;s&quot;, &quot;Make It Easy&quot;,&quot;It&#8217;s All In Your Mind&quot;, &quot;Look Out Your Window Baby I&#8217;m On Your Porch&quot;, &quot;Baby Doll&quot;, &quot;It&#8217;s Alright By Me&quot;,&nbsp;&quot;Dangerous! Dynamite!&quot;, &quot;You Know My Number&quot;, &quot;Freeloader&quot;,&quot;When I Get You&quot;, &quot; If I Were Ever Minus You&quot;,&quot;Movin&#8217; Right Along&quot;,&quot;You Really Get To Me&quot;,&#8230;and dozens of other tunes that have&nbsp;never before been heard by anyone outside of the band members themselves. All of it was written by the&nbsp;Blue Ash songwriting team of Bill &quot;Cupid&quot; Bartolin and Frank Secich. The songs were recorded in Youngstown, Ohio&nbsp;at Peppermint studios between 1972 and 1976. More details will be forthcoming here at &quot;Lost In The Grooves&quot; in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>ABOUT THE BOOK: Pop music history is full of little-known musicians, whose work stands defiantly alone, too quirky, distinctive, or demented to appeal to a mass audience. And even the well-known musicians are frequently misplaced or misunderstood within that pop history. The book <em>Lost in the Grooves: Scram&rsquo;s Capricious Guide to the Music You Missed</em> explores the nooks and crannies of the pop music world, unearthing lost gems from should-have-been major artists (Sugarpie DeSanto, Judee Sill), revisiting lesser known works by established icons (Marvin Gaye&rsquo;s post-divorce kissoff album, <em>Here My Dear</em>; The Ramones&rsquo; <em>Subterranean Jungle</em>), and spotlighting musicians who simply don&rsquo;t fit into neat categories (k. mccarty, Exuma). The encyclopedic alphabetical structure throws off strange sparks as disparate genres and eras rub against each other: folk-psych iconoclasts face louche pop crooners; indie rock bumps against eighties soul which jostles proto-punk; outsider artists set their odd masterpieces down next to obscurities from the stars; lo-fi garage rock cuddles up with the French avant-garde; and roots rock weirdoes trip over bubblegum. This book will delight any jukebox junkie or pop culture enthusiast.</p>
