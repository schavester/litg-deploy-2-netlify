<p>Take three guys with a dozen songs or so of roughly three to four minutes apiece into a studio in Jersey with just a few instruments and not that many tracks to over-produce across for two weeks only and what do you get?</p>
<p>Well, in the case of Dipsomaniac Mick ChorbaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s self-confessed Ã¢â‚¬Å“lo-fi side project with alt. counry overtonesÃ¢â‚¬Â <a href="https://www.thesuccessfulfailures.com/"><strong>The Successful Failures</strong></a>, you more than ably get to recreate that fleeting Golden Age of the Paley Brothers, Greg Kihn and Rubinoos anew, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what!</p>
<p>And guess what else?  Well, one can hear precisely the kind of potent musical potient Ryan Adams, for one, is in most dire need of right about now (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sewer WaterÃ¢â‚¬Â), one can savor again all the Farfisic paisley garage-pop of the classic <a href="https://www.geocities.com/Vienna/Strasse/4541/cheep1.jpg"><strong>circa-Ã¢â‚¬â„¢86 Cheepskates</strong></a> (Ã¢â‚¬Å“What You AreÃ¢â‚¬Â), one can imagine Poco hiring Pete Ham to write them a rightful middle-eight (Ã¢â‚¬Å“God KnowsÃ¢â‚¬Â) or The Replacements threw some brand new ProTools even (Ã¢â‚¬Å“If ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Way That You Want ItÃ¢â‚¬Â).</p>
<p>But no, that <em>still </em>ainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t all!  Coz Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hick BarsÃ¢â‚¬Â may as well be the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first-ever lovingly lowly mp3, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Letting The Terrorists WinÃ¢â‚¬Â once and hopefully for all relegates John AshcroftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s <a href="https://www.symbolman.com/corpabuse.html"><strong>Ã¢â‚¬Å“Let The Eagle SoarÃ¢â‚¬Â</strong></a> to the Axis of Evil Besides, and even the Bonus Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Am A RockÃ¢â‚¬Â Track is SO much more a pleasant <em>Surprise</em> than P. SimonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest ever will be, believe you me.</p>
<p>So, as recent all-American events more than repeatedly demonstrate, only the <em>most</em> successful fail upwards, and this CD certainly isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t about to prove otherwise, God knows. </p>
