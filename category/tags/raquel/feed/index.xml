										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" width="120" height="130" border="0" src="https://www.raquelsboys.com/images/Spy_Business.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the best albums <a href="https://www.earcandymag.com/missedgold2005.htm" target="_self"><strong>you may have missed in 2005</strong></a> was made by Vermont&rsquo;s latest phenomenal pop combo, the men with the mojo themselves (that&rsquo;s all in <em>their</em> own words, of course);&nbsp; yes, I virtually speak of none other than Raquel&rsquo;s Boys, and their <em>Music For The Girl You Love</em>.</p>
<p>Well, that was then, but NOW they&rsquo;ve just recorded their very second long-player, <em>The Spy Business</em>, and it just may be every bit as clandestinely coooool as their first outing was, and forever shall be:</p>
<p>Kicking straight off with &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Live,&rdquo; the Great Neil Young / Big Star Duet That (unfortunately) Never Was, the boys&rsquo; latest forty minutes is more than chockfull of semi-reverent nods towards the sonic past (&ldquo;Alice Faye&rdquo; may just as well be the choicest of all possible pre-Cheap Trick demos, &ldquo;Underdog&rdquo; pits David Watts vs. Victoria and the Bubblegum-go-round, then &ldquo;Springtime&rdquo; absolutely squeals out for a brand new Turtles album already!!). &nbsp;</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not all:&nbsp; &ldquo;The Greatest Show Of All&rdquo; and &ldquo;Undercover&rdquo; especially truly deserve immediate soundtrack duty on the Cartoon Network&rsquo;s latest Puffy TV series, while &ldquo;Orange Soda&rdquo; &ndash; appearing very soon indeed on JAM Recordings&rsquo; next <a href="https://www.jamrecordings.com/catalog.php?inventory_id=1281" target="_self"><strong><em>This Is Rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; Roll Radio</em></strong></a> comp &#8212; takes Teenage Fanclub down to the local Dairy Queen and THEN some.</p>
<p>Still, your ears, like mine, may find themselves most drawn to an uncharacteristically Raquelian sweet and even soft trio of tracks (&ldquo;Pupils,&rdquo; &ldquo;Only Kisses,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pal&rdquo;) which are as delightfully delicate musically as they are intriguing lyrically.&nbsp; Such nice li&rsquo;l totally disarming charmers they are, you know.</p>
<p>So, this album isn&rsquo;t quite out yet, I do not think.&nbsp; But when it <em>does</em> appear, you know I&rsquo;ll be all over it for you, yes indeed.</p>
<p>Stay Totally Tuned then&hellip;..&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
