										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reviews by P. Edwin Letcher</p>
<p>CRASH COFFIN Self titled CD (Radioactive)&#8230; Crash Coffin is a fellow from Ohio who put together a band and recorded ten of his songs on a local label back in 1970. Crash had a good grasp on singing, storytelling and songwriting as well as a working knowledge of various musical genres. This CD contains &#8220;Masochist Blues&#8221; and &#8220;the Looney Polka&#8221; as well as eight others that are not as readily pegged as belonging to a particular musical style. One song, &#8220;Freedom Cake,&#8221; could have given the Lovin&#8217; Spoonful some serious competition in the jug band pop field. Crash had a strong and smooth voice with plenty of Elvis that crept in around the edges. This is actually a pretty good record that I&#8217;ve gone back to more than once. I especially like the closing track, a rambling folk pop ditty about Jesus stealing his &#8220;Blue Kazoo.&#8221; Mr. Coffin did individual artwork for the covers of the few copies of the LP that actually made it into the hands of the public because he couldn&#8217;t afford to have the covers printed. It&#8217;s a shame because this could have been a popular record with a little support from a label. </p>
<p>FIFTH FLIGHT &#8220;Into Smoke Tree Village&#8221; CD (Radioactive)&#8230; Radioactive Records digs deep to find lost records of the past and make them available to a fanatical bunch of &#8217;60s and &#8217;70s enthusiasts. Fifth Flight was probably a popular high school hop band. They were a bit luckier than a lot of other groups doing covers of radio hits in the late &#8217;60s because they actually got to record a whole album. Their set opens with a middle of the road original called &#8220;Can&#8217;t You See?&#8221; The rest of the record is made up of pedestrian versions of songs like &#8220;Midnight Hour&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;d Like to Make it with You.&#8221; It&#8217;s too bad they didn&#8217;t have a prolific tunesmith onboard to give them something to work with because they were decent musicians. This will enlighten anyone wondering what a competent group of musicians working the top 40 circuit in 1969 was like. </p>
<p>THE FLOOR &#8220;1st Floor&#8221; CD (Radioactive)&#8230; The band was known as the Hitmakers until 1967 when the changing times brought about a radical reincarnation in the Danish beat group. They brought in a fifth member, changed their name and set about Sgt. Pepperizing everything. There is a great photo on the back cover of the band, in their psychedelic finery, along with their various managers, composers, studio musicians, conductors, technicians&#8230; and coffee-lady. This is some of the finest introspective pop with orchestral backing of its era. Things get a tad too LSD silly with songs like &#8220;Hey, Mr. Flowerman&#8221; and &#8220;A Rainbow Around Us,&#8221; but others have more of a Zombies sensibility. In a fair world, music historians would be mentioning this album in the same breath as Herman&#8217;s Hermits&#8217; &#8220;Blaze,&#8221; but the Continent never got as much attention as England or America. Maybe this re-release will set things straight. </p>
<p>THE SIDETRACK &#8220;Baby&#8221; CD (Radioactive)&#8230; Radioactive Records can be counted on to dig up some very obscure music from the &#8217;60s and &#8217;70s, but this one is more enigmatic than the average overlooked also ran. The label couldn&#8217;t dig up a photo of the group and the band never came up with artwork for this eleven-track demo. The best guess of the person who reviewed these songs for the label is that the band is from the late &#8217;60s/ early &#8217;70s. That sounds about right. This could almost pass for the British band Fields. It&#8217;s chock full of piano, organ and harpsichord and incorporates elements of classical music in its post-psychedelic rock explorations. While trying to zero in on its own unique sound, the band dabbled in a sort of blues/ Gregorian chant fusion and extended funky jazzy noodling among other odd combinations of eras and genres. The production is good, but the songs could be a lot<br />
more memorable. </p>
