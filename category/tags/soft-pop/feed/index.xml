										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is my first LITG Blog, and in fact my first blog at all.  I am happy to be here, and will keep this first one brief.  My most recent discovery of an obscure and great record comes courtesy of The Big Takeover magazine, who did a piece in their last issue on Nick Garrie (Hamilton).  The article had me running to get Garrie&#8217;s late 60s lost masterpiece record, The Nightmate of J.B. Stanislas.  Wow.  Think the soft, orchestrated pop of Bergen White  running into more &#8220;serious&#8221; folk stuff by, say, Nick Drake, then having some encounters with the Baroque pop of The Left Banke, the left of center melodic singer/songwriter sounds of Harry Nilsson and . . . I could go on with the comparisons, but let&#8217;s just say this is a great record that the people of Rev-Ola have put back into the world for us.  If you&#8217;re into sprawling, pyschedelic folk/pop from the late 60s, Nick is your man and this record will hit your sweet spot.  My apologies if anyone on this site has already raved about this record.</p>
<p>Amazon has the record, and if you prefer to buy from your local shop, get them to order it if they don&#8217;t have it on the shelf.</p>

<p>Ten years before recording this 1969 orchestral pop disc in Toronto, east coast folkie Dobson wrote &#8220;Morning Dew&#8221; in a fit of nuclear angst, then watched as half the singers on the scene made it their own. She revisits her standard here, alongside several similarly moody originals and covers of &#8220;Get Together,&#8221; &#8220;Everybody&#8217;s Talkin'&#8221; and lesser-known offerings like arranger Ben McPeek&#8217;s Indian-tinged &#8220;Bird in Space.&#8221; Dobson has a seductive, jazzy quality that works best on the more subdued tunes like the sweet, Francophone &#8220;Pendant Que,&#8221; but which gets lost in shrillness whenever the strings get too hyperactive. A pleasant offering, if over-produced and less personal than a songwriter&#8217;s self-titled album should have been.</p>

<p>Reissue of a 1969 harmony-pop disk on Capitol, produced by David Axelrod under the not-quite-anagramic Lex de Azevedo. The cousins King were music industry pros with a family TV show and the connections to get their nascent quartet a regular slot on John Davidson&rsquo;s <em>Kraft Summer Music Hall</em>. Blonde, slick and resoundingly old-fashioned despite the matching mini-dresses on the cover, in the studio they brought their frosty, elevator-ready pipes to arrangements of Beatles, Boyce &amp; Hart, Hamlisch, Bacharach-David and Nichols-Asher that veer from the tasteful to the mildly twangy and tuff. The best track is &ldquo;God Only Knows,&rdquo; where their ethereal ice princess sexiness really suits the material. Like an estrogenic Carpenters without the angst, these four twenty-somethings made music for people the sum of their combined ages. </p>
