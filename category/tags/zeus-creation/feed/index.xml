										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>And to what pleasure do we owe this 25 cent treasure found all seven inches of in a Powell Street furniture store, hmm? With its&#8217; aquamarine logo that relays label name Psi Records, a trident jutting out betwixt the two words. The label address is 1747 W. 3rd Ave., Vancouver, B.C. The printed phone number of 732-3761, when called, knew no knowledge of this record, catalog number 101. Year unknown. The group was The Outraged Husbands. The song &#8220;Zeus Creation&#8221; is the sounds of a group of men boisterously chanting along with marching band style orchestration, &#8220;We are the men of the nation, we like the ladies in their place, so we say down with the women&#8217;s liberation and up with Zeus Creation! We like the girls who wear bikinis, cool chicks are never ever cold&#8230;&#8221;<br />
What follows next is an endless litany of household chore commands and how, after all that, the women must &#8220;look like a doll&#8221; when they get home. The song signs off with, &#8220;Men! Wonderful men! Sensational men!&#8221; And applause. It all clocks in at one minute and fifty four seconds. Flip the record over and it&#8217;s the exact same thing. Was this song a tongue-in-cheek response to Women&#8217;s Lib or was it a satire on the misogynist response to Women&#8217;s Lib? This record seems too out and out ridiculous to be made as a fear based reaction to equality. Still, who or what was this mysterious Zeus Creation?<br />
One large question remains: who made this record?</p>
