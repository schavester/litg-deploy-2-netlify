<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">When it comes to female teen-pop singers in the 1980s, Debbie Gibson and Tiffany are the names most people know.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">But in 1984 &#8212; two years before either those two teen queens even released a song &#8212; <span>Ã‚Â </span>a 15-year-old New York-based singer named <strong>Alisha </strong>was burning up the dance charts with a tune called Ã¢â‚¬Å“All Night Passion.Ã¢â‚¬Â</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The problem was that the dance charts were pretty much all Alisha burned up. Ã¢â‚¬Å“All Night Passion,Ã¢â‚¬Â which boasted a sultry medium tempo and fervent vocal, hit Number Three on BillboardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dance chart, but it only got as high as Number 103 on the Hot 100 (which means it just hit BillboardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bubbling UnderÃ¢â‚¬Â chart).</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Maybe the tune was arranged in too much of a Ã¢â‚¬Å“freestyleÃ¢â‚¬Â dance style for mass consumption. Or maybe the arbiters of pop taste felt the chorus of Ã¢â‚¬Å“All night passion gets me through the dayÃ¢â‚¬Â was too risquÃƒÂ© for a 15-year-old to be singing. Whatever the case, it unfortunately set the tone of the career of Alisha Itkin, who would have lots of dance chart success, but would never have a pop single rise higher than Number 54.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Of course, the teen music scene that exploded in the late 1990s didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t exist in the early 1980s. Even in the mid-1980s the music of Debbie Gibson and Tiffany was regularly derided in the mainstream press (OK, so their music wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pet Sounds,Ã¢â‚¬Â but it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t half bad either). In the 1980s, music coverage was still all about what the Baby Boomers were listening to, and teen music wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t given serious press attention until the Baby BoomersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ kids started listening to it a generation later.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">These facts at least partially explain why AlishaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best single, the brilliant Madonna knock-off Ã¢â‚¬Å“Baby Talk,Ã¢â‚¬Â only rose to Number 68 in late 1985. Why listen to fun teen sounds when you have, like, Huey Lewis and Phil Collins?</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">And make no mistake, AlishaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first album was designed for total teen appeal.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The cover featured the singer in a very Ã¢â‚¬Å“teenage girlÃ¢â‚¬Â pose Ã¢â‚¬â€œ perched on her bed with telephone in band. More an extended EP than an LP, it showcases the production techniques of Mark Berry, which then sounded futuristic, but now probably sound retro to anyone under 40.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">lisha released a second LP and got a song on the soundtrack of the romantic comedy Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mannequin,Ã¢â‚¬Â which featured Kim Cattrall in her pre-Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sex and the CityÃ¢â‚¬Â days. As the decade turned, her cover of Fire on BlondeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bounce BackÃ¢â‚¬Â became her biggest hit of all, rising to Number 54 on the pop charts. It also earned her a place on countless dance compilations (and endless spins on the USA NetworkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dance Party U.S.A.Ã¢â‚¬Â teen dance show).</font></p>
