<p>Sure,<br />every time this year,<br />as temps and spirits begin to rise<br />and the time gets right for doing <br /><em>something</em> in the street,</p>
<p>we could So easily get <br />laid back and lost within the usual grooves<br />of those <a href="https://www.cosmik.com/aa-august00/gary62.html"><strong>Beach Boys</strong></a>,<br /><a href="/?p=208"><strong>Jan and/or Dean</strong></a>,<br /><a href="https://d.hatena.ne.jp/hiromuguinn/20060926/p1"><strong>Fantastic Baggys</strong></a> (!!!)<br />or even <a href="https://www.beachpartymoviemusic.com/TheScoreofPajamaParty.html"><strong>Los Nooney Rickett Four</strong></a>.</p>
<p>but,<br />If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re ready for a brand <em>new</em> beat instead<br />all this summer long,</p>
<p>May I suggest you tune on, log in,<br />turn up and hang at least 10dB<br />right over there at<br /><a href="https://www.garypiggold.com/"><strong>Gary Pig Gold dot com</strong></a>,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several of the inimitably esteemed recording artistes I had the pleasure of becoming <em>Lost In The Grooves</em> with have recently made grand new releases available to discriminating listeners and/or readers out there in what remains of the real world.&nbsp; Yes of course there&rsquo;s head Kink Ray&rsquo;s LONG-awaited so-low album (which sounds not too bad at all to what&rsquo;s left of these ears), but what truly is exciting me this week is <a target="_self" href="https://www.sundazed.com/"><strong>Sundazed&rsquo;s</strong></a> full-color re-release of that last &ldquo;real&rdquo; <a target="_self" href="https://jananddean-janberry.com/"><strong>Jan and Dean</strong></a> long-player, <em>Popsicle</em>.</p>
<p>In truth a hasty grab-bag of hits, misses, and miscellania circa &rsquo;62 thru &rsquo;66 cobbled together to, um, commemorate Captain Jan Berry&rsquo;s recent near-fatal car crash, the <em>Popsicle</em> album actually provides just as wild and crazy a ride as yer typical J&amp;D LP ever would (e.g.: Side Four of <em>The Jan &amp; Dean Anthology Album</em>, anyone?!!) as it veers madly from the ridiculous (&ldquo;One-Piece Topless Bathing Suit,&rdquo; perhaps the funniest Sloan/Barri composition this side of &ldquo;Eve Of Destruction&rdquo;) to the sublime (Jan&rsquo;s tongue-possibly-deep-within-cheek &ldquo;Norwegian Wood&rdquo;) and THEN some (a fully half-an-album&rsquo;s worth of selections with either &ldquo;Summer&rdquo; or &ldquo;Surf&rdquo; in the song-titles themselves: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s My Summer Girl&rdquo; has long been a quite guilty pleasure-o-mine, you know, while J&amp;D&rsquo;s &ldquo;Summer Means Fun&rdquo; more than hangs ten against the Fantastic Baggys&rsquo; near-identical version, I&rsquo;ll have YOU know).</p>
<p>So as Jan lay hovering next to death in nearby UCLA Medical Center, and his until-then hapless cohort Dean &ldquo;The Boy Blunder&rdquo; scoured the vaults to fulfill the duo&rsquo;s contractual commitment to Liberty Records, &ldquo;Popsicle&rdquo; the song &#8212; originally appearing as &ldquo;Popsicle Truck&rdquo; on the November &rsquo;63 <em>Drag City</em> album &#8212; crept to the mid-twenties on the sales charts (I can distinctly remember it jumping from my childhood six-transistors as that fateful Summer of 66 was about to arrive), providing a sticky-sweet if tragically premature capper to the initial career of our most fave pop duo this side of Don &amp; Phil.&nbsp; But <em>Popsicle</em> the ALBUM is in retrospect as fine a place as any to immediately reacquaint oneself with the majesty and true mondo-magic which was, and forever shall be, Jan Berry and Dean O. Torrence &hellip;until Sundazed gets very round to re-issuing their beyond-classic <em>Jan &amp; Dean Meet Batman</em>, that is !!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
