										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img border="0" src="http://b2.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/00094/29/60/94250692_s.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, Japan has already given us, in semi- chronological order, The Blue Comets, The Tigers, coooool live albums from The Ventures, Honeycombs, and the late, very great Buck Owens, plus of course those twin teen titans themselves <a href="http://www.cosmik.com/aa-september02/gary87.html" target="_self"><strong>Puffy (Ami Yumi)</strong></a>.&nbsp; <em>Domo arigato</em>, I believe is the only applicable phrase right here.</p>
<p>Nobly carrying quite on with that super-fine tradition is the one and only Daisuke Kambe and his Tokyo-based Wizzard In Vinyl label.&nbsp; He, and they, have been responsible for bringing to discriminating ears worldwide the untold pleasures of The Playmates (Jam meet Hamburg Beatles!), Treeberrys (best cover-art graphics since at least The Association), Movin&rsquo; Jelly (deftly ready to pick up if NRBQ ever decide to leave off), plus only the very very highest quality non- J-Pop from across the globe, including our <a target="_self" href="https://www.lostinthegrooves.com/?p=571"><strong>aforementioned Bill Lloyd</strong></a>.&nbsp; Why, I think you&rsquo;ll even hear Yours Quite Truly singing my <em>Who&rsquo;s Next</em> version of &ldquo;Rock And Roll Love Letter&rdquo; on the <a target="_self" href="http://www.epinions.com/content_115297259140"><strong><em>Men In Plaid</em></strong></a> Rollers tribute disc in there somewhere&#8230;</p>
<p>However, Daisuke&rsquo;s latest gracious Package to Pig contained above-exceptional <em>new</em> discs by two combos ALL Lost Groovers should hook onto asap imho: &nbsp;</p>
<p>First, there&rsquo;s those living coloured <a target="_self" href="http://www5d.biglobe.ne.jp/~rabbitrc/"><strong>Oranges</strong></a>, upon whose so-aptly-titled <em>Teen Rock</em> are squeezed twenty wholly-rockin&rsquo; sound-biters in fifty minutes flat.&nbsp; Had Eric Carmen continued writing Top Tens for Shaun Cassidy;&nbsp; had Herman and his Hermits mid-wifed that l-u-v child dem Ramones sorrowfully never sired&hellip; in other words, The Oranges taste no less like one gigantic, sugary-Sweet, Chinni-Chapping all-day sucker for the lower extremities, believe you me!</p>
<p>And, as if that wasn&rsquo;t all, Here Come <a target="_self" href="http://www.mayflowers.tv/"><strong>The Mayflowers</strong></a>, who are never once afraid to pack a whole lotta Power deep into their Pop.&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s just as if Jellyfish played one big Cheap Trick at the XTC / Hollies summit meeting which, until now, never got a chance to happen.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Yes, you just gotta check any, or ideally <em>all</em> of the above,<br />available right now right there at, in Daisuke&rsquo;s own words, &ldquo;the <a target="_self" href="http://www.wizzard-in-vinyl.com/"><strong>best place</strong></a> for crystalline guitarpop &amp; crunchy powerpop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tell &lsquo;em Puffy Gary sentcha&hellip;.. </p>
