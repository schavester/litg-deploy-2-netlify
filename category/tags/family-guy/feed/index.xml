										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are familiar with the authors on this website, you will notice that alot of the blogs are about the 1980&#8217;s. To teenagers today, the eighties was a complicated time&#8211; filled with change, baby formula, and first words (mine were all four verses of Elton John&#8217;s Rocket Man). </p>
<p>Since most teenagers didn&#8217;t experience the eighties, it is viewed by many of the members of Generation Y as a decade filled with Pac-Man, bad hair, and ugly shirts. But thanks to Family Guy, a popular show created by televisionary Seth MacFarlane, teens today are getting a little dose of the eighties once more&#8211; this time without the Gerber.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In 1986, the music video for A-Ha&#8217;s single, &#8216;Take On Me&#8217; was nominated for an MTV Music Video award&#8211; and for good reason. The movie version of &#8216;Take On Me,&#8217; featuring a special type of animation known as &quot;roto-scoping,&quot; was a smash hit the US and UK alike, and quickly made A-Ha one of the most popular bands of the 1980&#8217;s. </p>
<p>It has been more then twenty years since &#8216;Take On Me&#8217; was popular, but it only took a fifty-second segment on Family Guy to bring it all back, providing you old-timers with a healthy bit of nostalgia and us youngsters with yet another punchy Family Guy gem. </p>
<p>Take a look </p>

<p>Chew on that. It&#8217;s delicious.</p>
<p>Until Next Time:</p>
