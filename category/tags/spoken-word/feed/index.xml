Or, because by then my ears and mind have finally tuned to the proper channels for the attentive listening this record deserves. Disc 2 is an instrumental bonus disc that is on the same expressive ambient music plane. After being inspired by the voice of Alex Caldiero, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fun to listen to and decide what words it makes me want to say.</span></p>
