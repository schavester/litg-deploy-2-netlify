										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have heard lots of complaints about the <strong>Collectors Choice</strong> label, about the sound quality of their CDs, and the cheapness of the packaging.  But I love this label, because they reissue all kinds of obscure music, from various decades and genres, that nobody else would.  My latest Collectors Choice find is the album <em>Will You Be Staying After Sunday</em>, by the late 60s Baltimore soft rock band <strong>Peppermint Rainbow</strong>.  This is <strong>Spanky and Our Gang</strong> meets <strong>The Lemon Pipers</strong>, and is 30 minutes of pure pyschedelic bubblegum bliss.  The title track, which seems to be referencing Spanky&#8217;s &quot;Sunday Will Never Be the Same,&quot; is rich with soaring harmonies and vocal hooks.  &quot;Pink Lemonade&quot; picks right up from there, with its candy-coated acid vibe.  And although those are the best two songs on the 11-track album, it is all pleasant and there is nothing on the record that you mind hearing again.   I love the photo of the band on the back cover of the CD almost as much as the music inside.  All five members (three guys/two sisters, one of the sisters married to one of the guys) look out of place in the gaudy hippy clothing they&#8217;re wearing, the men with sky blue ascots and the women in matching-colored dresses and white go-go boots; they look like a pack of hillbillies who got invited to a party at a drug house and went to the hippy boutique and asked what they should wear.  But when they play and sing there&#8217;s no confusion at all.  They are masters of melodic soft rock and this album goes on my all-time list of greats in that style, alongside records by people like <strong>The Sandpipers</strong>, Lemon Pipers, <strong>Strawberry Alarm Clock</strong>, <strong>Merry-Go-Round</strong>, <strong>Cowsills</strong>, etc.</p>
