<p>I&#39;ve been procrastinating for the better part of a year, but I&#39;m finally ready to announce thatÃ‚Â I&#39;m head over heels for Natalie Gordon, the extraordinarily talented singer, songwriter, and guitarist for Sacramento&#39;s Agent Ribbons.Ã‚Â  So groovy and gorgeousÃ‚Â is she that it didn&#39;t take long for her to officially become my local celebrity crush (although the comely lass who works at a nearby Newsbeat is pretty darn worthy as well.)Ã‚Â  Here, take a gander and you&#39;ll see what I mean:</p>
<p>Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  <img loading="lazy" src="http://submergemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/natalie_agent-ribbonsweb.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" /></p>
<p>Yeah, she&#39;s a doll alright, butÃ‚Â you ain&#39;t gonna hear her music just by staring at her. That&#39;s why I&#39;m here to let you know that Agent Ribbons&#39; debut release <em>On Time Travel and Romance</em> has given Sacramento another reason to be proud of its homegrown musicians. It all began when Natalie befriended Lauren Hess in a downtown used record storeÃ‚Â (which happens to be the very same store featured on theÃ‚Â cover of DJ Shadow&#39;s magnum opus <em>Entroducing . . .</em>Ã‚Â  )Ã‚Â  This meeting of minds gave Natalie a renewed interest in her musical ambitions and inspired her to form a band (<span class="hw"><font size="3"><span class="hw"><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana">ÃƒÂ  la </span></span></font></span>Art Brut) with Lauren sitting in on drums. Agent Ribbons has a decidedly retro sound thanks to Natalie&#39;s focus on vaudeville, cabaret,Ã‚Â and blues traditions in her songs, but she still manages to put a contemporary spin on everything she touches. Writing stories about looking for love after death and running off to join the circus, Natalie has a talent for dishing outÃ‚Â the whimsy without ever sounding overly cute.Ã‚Â  And her vocal on &quot;Birds and Bees&quot; is so hypnotically sensuous that it&#39;s become a permanent fixture on my profile on MySpace. Natalie and Lauren welcomed violinist Naomi Cherie into the mix in 2009 and recorded a forthcoming follow-up called <em>Chateau Crone</em>, so it seems they&#39;re all set to prove they&#39;re not just one-trick ponies. Sadly, the ladies haven&#39;t been able to make ends meet in their hometown and will be moving to Austin this year with the hope of greater success. With Natalie&#39;s promise of frequent visits to Sacramento, I wish them all the luck in the world!</p>
