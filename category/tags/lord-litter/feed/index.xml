<p>Direct from the quite-legendarily <a target="_self" href="http://www.tomlou.com/unsound.html"><em>Unsound</em></a> Home CD Series, in the above-grand tradition of the magnificent Mungo Jerry, with all the semi-fi glory of the more <em>Scoop</em>-sublime Pete Townshend, and harkening straight back to those distant daze when <em>People Were Fair And Had Sky In Their Hair </em>comes my old <a target="_self" href="http://www.lordlitter.de/stations.html"><strong>media</strong></a> and genre-hopping pal <a target="_self" href="http://www.lordlitter.de/"><strong>Lord Litter</strong></a> alongside his lifelong right-hand guitarzan Lefty Leech.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now together these two raving folkabillies, armed with a mere twelve strings strung up two acoustics between them (plus the odd dash of keys &lsquo;n&rsquo; beat here and then there), slap-happily produce a rhythmic revue as wholly unhinged as it is simply unplugged.&nbsp; And not surprising at all, is it, with just one look at their choice of source material &ndash; Marriott/Lane, the Young Springfield, Edmunds and Cash and even John and Paul &ndash; decisively proving L &amp; L are more than extremely out on the right channel throughout this bold new socio-musical mission of theirs.</p>
<p>So if you have ever for one moment wondered exactly what those silvery Beatles might sound like if they were still today playing Sunday matinees at the Kaiserkeller or Star Club, <em>Introducing Litter and Leech</em> is the closest any of us may ever truly get to revisiting then recreating, as these two surely have, the rockin&rsquo; way the roll <em>used</em> to be &#8230;before it became content to wear stars on its brow, that is. </p>
<p><a target="_self" href="http://www.lordlitter.de/releases_litter_leech.html"><strong><em>Introduce</em> yourself today</strong></a> then, I say.&nbsp; Being sure to tell &lsquo;em Gary the Pig sentcha, of course.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;</p>
