										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blue Ash is glad and honored to be part of the &quot;Lost In The Grooves&quot; family. This is a brief history of&nbsp;the band. Blue Ash was formed in 1969 by Frank Secich (bass guitar), Jim Kendzor (vocals), Bill &quot;Goog&quot; Yendrek (lead guitar) and David Evans (drums). The band debuted at a psychedelic club called &quot;The Freak Out&quot; in Youngstown, Ohio on October 3, 1969. Determined to go against the then omnipresent long-guitar-solo-jam bands, Blue Ash would forge a style in the manner of their own teen-aged years heroes: Beatles, Who, Kinks, Byrds, Beau Brummels, Hollies, Rolling Stones, Yardbirds, and many others mixed in from the mid-60&#8217;s. Coupled with a wild stage-show and the management of Geoffrey Jones, Blue Ash soon became very popular on the teen-dance and club circuit of PA, NY, Ohio and W.VA. In October of 1970, guitarist Bill Yendrek was replaced by Bill Bartolin. For the next few years Blue Ash played a hectic 200-250 dates a year throughout the region. During that time the songwriting team of Secich-Bartolin were stockpiling an enormous amount of original material.&nbsp;In 1972, they were signed to a recording contract with Mercury Records by the late , great (legendary A&amp;R man/ rock writer)&nbsp;Paul Nelson. Paul also signed&nbsp;&quot; The New York Dolls&quot;&nbsp;around the same time.&nbsp;Their debut lp &quot;No More, No Less&quot; (1973) received rhapsodic reviews in the rock press. Blue Ash along with Big Star and Raspberries became critical darlings of a new sound later to be called &quot;power pop&quot;. With not enough sales or FM airplay came the death knell to the first wave of 70&#8217;s power pop bands. Blue Ash continued on and in 1977 released a 2nd lp on Playboy Records. In 1979 the band broke up. In the ensuing years Blue Ash developed a world-wide cult following with many groups recording their songs: Records, Finkers, Michael Monroe to name a few. Over the years there was rumoured to be tons of unreleased Blue Ash material. In 2004, Not Lame Records released a 2CD set of it with 44 songs called &quot;Around Again&quot;. Blue Ash is now reformed (but not too reformed) and play out occasionally. The band consists of all 4 original members plus 2nd drummer Jeff Rozniata, Bob Darke (bass) and Brian Wingrove (piano, vocals).
