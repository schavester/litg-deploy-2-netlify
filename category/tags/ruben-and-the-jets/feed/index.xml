										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" width="380" height="330" border="0" src="https://www.ralf.com/im_item/6051_main.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;The recording of <em>Sgt. Pepper&rsquo;s Lonely Hearts Club Band </em>spanned 129 days; perhaps the most creative 129 days in the history of rock music.&rdquo;<br /><em>(author and &ldquo;Beatle Brain of Britain&rdquo; Mark Lewisohn) &nbsp;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst those &ldquo;Fugs of the West Coast,&rdquo; The Mothers of Invention, were spending month upon month held over in New York City&rsquo;s Garrick Theatre performing their 1967 <em>Pigs and Repugnant</em> Revue, Frank Zappa was spending his every waking hour <em>off</em> stage holed up in the city&rsquo;s pioneering 12-track (!!) Apostolic recording studio over on East 10th.&nbsp; The ultra-productive time spent there, which resulted in not only the epic <a target="_self" href="/?p=793"><strong><em>We&rsquo;re Only In It For The Money</em></strong></a> but several other stellar FZ / MOI LP&rsquo;s (not to mention reams of archival material which continues to dribble out posthumously via the Zappa Family Trust), constitutes what I firmly believe to be THE most fitfully fruitful time ever spent by man or beast committing rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll to magnetic tape &hellip;and yes, that includes those pious <em>Pepper</em> sessions as well.</p>
<p>Right alongside Apostolic&rsquo;s utterly brilliant recording engineer Richard &ldquo;Dick Dynamite&rdquo; Kunc and his latest audio toys (variable speed oscillators, the grand new &ldquo;Apostolic Vlorch Injector,&rdquo; plus assorted policemen and breakfast rolls), Zappa and band stitched together, for starters, &quot;most of the music from  <a target="_self" href="https://www.edseeman.com/zappa/uncle%20meat%20blowup.jpg"><strong>the Mothers&#8217; movie</strong></a> of the same name which we haven&#8217;t got enough money to finish yet&quot; as well as the first, and I&rsquo;m sure you must agree, BEST of all those late-Sixties so-called R &lsquo;n&rsquo; R Revival elpees <strong><a target="_self" href="https://www.united-mutations.com/z/frank_zappa/zappa005.htm"><em>Cruising With Ruben and the Jets</em></a></strong>.</p>
<p>Now, while the <a target="_self" href="https://www.united-mutations.com/z/frank_zappa/zappa007.htm"><strong><em>Uncle Meat</em></strong></a> soundtrack still sounds as magnificently minced and phonically fully-flavored today as it did upon its &rsquo;69 release, the digitized <em>Ruben</em> most unfortunately suffers from a typically fool-headed remix and re-record which obliterates the Mother/Jets&rsquo; original greasy, bottom-heavy finger-snatting and replaces them all with synthesized bass sloops and Eighties-anemic drums-that-go-&ldquo;pooh&rdquo; (instead of <em>poot</em>), I&rsquo;m so sorry to report.&nbsp; &ldquo;When I sat down and listened to the CD I got sick in the pit of my stomach, man,&rdquo; so go the wizened words of Mother woodwinder Bunk Gardner (as reported in <a target="_self" href="https://www.ant-bee.com/"><strong>our ant bee</strong></a> Billy James&rsquo; indispensable <em>Necessity Is&hellip; The Early Years of Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention</em> book).&nbsp; &ldquo;The music was from one era and you could tell the rhythm section was from the 1980s; it didn&rsquo;t make sense at all to me.&nbsp; And the thing that blew my mind was, didn&rsquo;t Frank <em>hear</em> that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently not.&nbsp; Still, for those who naturally prefer jelly roll gum drops and Chevy &lsquo;39&rsquo;s over tangerine trees and newspaper taxis&#8230;.. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
