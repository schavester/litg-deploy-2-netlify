<p>If you are a fan of a newer artist by the name of Jack Johnson and have heard the soundtrack to the recent movie Curious George, there is a song by Johnson called &#8220;Upside Down&#8221; off of the soundtrack that is getting a lot of airplay right now. That song is very much like the style of Bobby Charles and reminds me of Charles&#8217; song Small Town Talk off of his self-titled album on Bearsville I talked a little about yesterday.  Charles&#8217; album is hard to find but is well worth searching out. It is sublime.</p>
<p>It was exciting to hear the song by Johnson as I am surprised radio is interested in that type of sound. It&#8217;s very cool and after I get done listening to more of Charles&#8217; music I may check out some of Johnson&#8217;s CDs. </p>
<p>That is all for today.</p>
