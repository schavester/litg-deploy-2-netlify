<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">After Madonna became a pop sensation in fall 1984, a lot of artists copped her style. Some used her sound as an influence, but others went whole hog and cooked up copycat records that sounded uncannily like the Material Girl.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Four Ã¢â‚¬Å“imitation MadonnaÃ¢â‚¬Â records were chart hits and all of them have been virtually forgotten. Until now. What follows is a chronological list oÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ discs, with their peak chart position listed first and the date they hit the charts second. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never heard these, finding them now will give you some new Ã¢â‚¬Å“old Madonna.Ã¢â‚¬Â Sort of. Anyway, without further adieu, we present Desperately Faking Madonna:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ã‚Â </font> </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>1. Jellybean Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sidewalk TalkÃ¢â‚¬Â (#18, 11/16/85).</strong> Club DJ and remix artist Jellybean Benitez was MadonnaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s boyfriend around the time of her first album. He eventually cut his own records, and this was his first chart hit. To be fair, this funky, synthesizer-fueled anti-gossip rant was penned by Madonna, who sings the choruses. But since she went uncredited and a vocal doppleganger namedÃ‚Â Catherine Buchanan sang the lead vocal, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s listed here. Tuneful but cloying after a while. Available now on the Ã¢â‚¬Å“FlawlessÃ¢â‚¬Â movie soundtrack.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ã‚Â </font> </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>2. Regina Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Baby LoveÃ¢â‚¬Â (#10, 6/21/86).</strong> Regina Richards was a true one-hit wonder and never charted at all outside of this record. Madonna collaborator Stephen Bray co-wrote it with her, and it sounds a bit like some of his other Madonna tunes (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Think of Me,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“Into the GrooveÃ¢â‚¬Â). The lyric is a boldly Madonna-esque assertion of female sexuality (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Boy, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no one home tonightÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Why should we pretend to be just friends?Ã¢â‚¬Â). Yet the melody is sentimental, giving the song an interesting ambiguous quality. Out of print.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ã‚Â </font> </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>3. Tia Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Boy Toy (#87, 3/7/87).</strong> Maybe forgotten singer Long Island singer-songwriter Tia didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have success with this record because she was too way derivative. Besides using MadonnaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trademark phrase for a title, she starts the disc by quoting her first hit, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Burning Up.Ã¢â‚¬Â The thunderous drums and synthetic handclaps make this production sound like it was meant for the dance floor, and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s probably where itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best heard. Shame we can&#39;t make a time machine and go back to an 1980s club. Oh well. Very out of print! </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Ã‚Â </strong></font> </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>4. Elisa Fiorello and Jellybean Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Who Found WhoÃ¢â‚¬Â (#16, 7/11/87).</strong> Sounding uncannily like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Live to TellÃ¢â‚¬Â-era Madge, 17-year-old Fiorello sings this pleading love song like she really means it. JellybeanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s production kicks a cool Ã¢â‚¬â„¢80s groove, with thwacking electric guitar and bell-like synth tones. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard toÃ‚Â imagine that back in the Reagan Era, this music sounded bold and daring and was an affront to the established rock sounds. It now comes off as positively sweet and innocent! Available on Ã¢â‚¬Å“1987: 20 Original Chart Hits.Ã¢â‚¬Â Or try YouTube.</font></p>
