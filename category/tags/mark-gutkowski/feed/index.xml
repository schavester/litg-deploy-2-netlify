<p> Not to be confused with the similarly-titled BMG collection for which I wrote the notes in 2001 (see below). If you&#8217;re seeking the most of this splendid bubblegum band you&#8217;ll need to pick up both discs, as there are six songs on the earlier release not on this mainly singles selection, among them the essential &quot;1910 Cotton Candy Castle.&quot; But if only one Fruitgum comp is in your future, it&#8217;d be hard to compete with this 28-track behemoth. I wish BMG had been as ambitious with their own vault artists as Germany&#8217;s Repertoire label! You&#8217;d have to dig through a lot of scuffy vinyl to assemble a comparable analog collection spanning the short, delicious career of this most infantile of semi-imaginary Buddah combos. Kicking off with the schoolyard earworm hits (including &quot;Simon Says,&quot; &quot;Indian Giver&quot; and &quot;1-2-3 Red Light&quot;), the disc also spotlights the band (or its studio doppelgangers) in its jazzy, psychedelic and garagey manifestations. The b-sides are highlights (and a rare chance to enjoy band-penned compositions), like the growling bad girl raver &quot;No Good Annie,&quot; and the Chinese psych-out &quot;Reflections from the Looking Glass.&quot; Equally great are the retarded (in a good way) &quot;Sticky Sticky&quot; and the Link-Wray-in-orbit stylings of &quot;Baby Bret.&quot; The comp closes with several scarce Italian-language tracks, from the Fruitgums&#8217; late, barely-noticed Continental phase, including the exquisitely spooky &quot;C&#8217;e Qualcosa Che Non Picardo Piu.&quot; The booklet includes notes from John Tracy and a selection of colorful 45 sleeves, sheet music covers and oddities.</p>
