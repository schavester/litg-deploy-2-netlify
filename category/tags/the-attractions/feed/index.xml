<p>Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mad About the Wrong Boy,Ã¢â‚¬Â the sole LP that The Attractions recorded without Elvis Costello is kind of like those people.</p>
<p>ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sweet and poppy upon first listen, with lots of shiny, happy melodies, and bubblegum-synth gurgles and squawks. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s even got a cute cover, featuring both an adorable little dog and a tasty-looking breakfast. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in the lyrics that the weirdness crops up, though. Songs touch on themes like self-loathing (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Damage MeÃ¢â‚¬Â), desperate housewives (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Highrise HousewifeÃ¢â‚¬Â), mindless conformity (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lonesome Little TownÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Straight JacketÃ¢â‚¬Â) and nuclear war (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Arms RaceÃ¢â‚¬Â). The albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tales of British life often recall The KinksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Village Green Preservation Society,Ã¢â‚¬Â but Ray DaviesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ wistfulness was supplanted by The AttractionsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ bitterness.</p>
<p>When the lyrics arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t dark, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re often inscrutable and very open to interpretation. For example, does the LPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Single GirlÃ¢â‚¬Â excoriate a self-centered career woman or the Ã¢â‚¬Å“virgin vigilantesÃ¢â‚¬Â that court her? Or is it just a breezy song with some oddball phrases thrown in? Considering how strong the songÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hooks are, maybe it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t matter what writers Ã¢â‚¬Å“Brian &amp; HartÃ¢â‚¬Â meant.</p>
<p>About that songwriting credit: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Brian &amp; HartÃ¢â‚¬Â is Attractions keyboardist Steve Nieve and his wife. I know this because he told it to me when I met him after a Costello concert in 1983. However, on the songs Nieve writes by himself, he confusingly uses the name Nieve. Got that? Bassist Bruce Thomas and drummer Pete Thomas chime in with a few songs (and play excellently throughout), but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mostly NieveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s show.</p>
<p>Seeing how this is being written for Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lost in the GroovesÃ¢â‚¬Â and not a site called Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Eighties Great HitsÃ¢â‚¬Â or something, it probably goes without saying that the public didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go mad for The AttractionsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wrong Boy.Ã¢â‚¬Â Rock critics Ã¢â‚¬â€œ who behaved towards Elvis Costello like 13-year-old girls behave towards Justin Timberlake Ã¢â‚¬â€œ could not emotionally handle a Costello-less Attractions LP and dismissed it as lightweight. But there are enough great tunes on this 16-song LP to make it consistently listenable. And to make you wish there had been a follow-up.</p>
<p><em>Ã‚Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mad About the Wrong BoyÃ¢â‚¬Â was originally released as F Beat XXLP8 in 1980 and was released on CD in 1999 by Demon Records. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s available on Amazon.com. </em></p>
