										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><font size="2"></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Building a music career is hard work. Every day, month and year you repeat the same grind: build the band, write the songs, record the songs, rehearse the songs, perform the songs, promote the band, advertise the band, solicit industry, publicize to the press, build the website, create the message boards, forums, and chat rooms, assemble the street teamÃ¢â‚¬Â¦it goes on and on until you think your head will surely explode from the mountains of menial tasks that face you, the unsigned artist, each day. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Still, after putting in all of that work a band will hit dry spells, slow times and glass ceilings. Some days, your already slow move forward, seems to retard even further. Sometimes it feels as though youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve peaked and will never advance. There are even days you want to blow off all of this tedious monotony, get a job in the electronics department at Target, and call it a day!</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>But even as your face is smushed up against the glass ceiling of a never-changing cycle of music business grunt work, hope is just over the horizon. See, there is something that you never stopped to think about all the while you were chasing the elusive brass ring of music stardomÃ¢â‚¬Â¦all of this time, you were in control. If opportunities have stopped coming your way, then make your own. If you want to be a rockstar, develop a situation you can star in and rock. You have the power and the ability to be anything and everything you have ever wanted to be if you learn to simply create your own buzz. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The following are a few tips that may help you to get started creating your own buzz in order to push past the obstacles and keeping moving down the Yellow Brick Road of musical superstardom:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>1.) Create Your Own Gigs&#8212;Tired of whining that you never get the gigs you want? You know: good clubs, weekend shows, prime slots, longer sets, decent pay, good bands on the bill, press attending, industry confirming and most importantly, your band headlining. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ridiculous to waste time complaining, when you could be booking, planning, promoting and playing your dreams gigs right now. Sure it will be a lot of time invested and it may mean putting smaller gigs on hold for awhile in order to promote one giant show, but the payoffs will inevitably outweigh the workÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and the best part is, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all about you. You are the promoter. You are the stars of the night. You pick the date, the times, the bands. You invite the press and the industry. Within a month or two, you could be playing the types of gigs you have always wanted, and all the while getting press, making money, collecting names for your mailing list and building hype for your band that even the stodgiest industry can take notice of.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>2.) Join The Ranks Of The Press And/Or The Industry&#8212;You know what they sayÃ¢â‚¬Â¦if you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t beat them, join them. If you want to get industry or press to notice you and your band, what better way than to become a member of the industry or press. Pick up a gig writing for a local magazine and review your friendsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ bands and the shows you promote. Intern at a record label and meet friends in the industry to invite to your gigs. Start a management/promotion company and book your band and your friendsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ bands to become better acquainted with clubs and their booking agents. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find it will be much easier to deal with industry people when they consider you more of a peer and not just another band asking for help. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>3.) Numbers, Numbers, Numbers&#8212;It may sound ridiculous but in the entertainment industry (as in any business), your perceived worth is tracked by your numbers. Web posters, gig patrons and listeners of your music all translate to numbers and the big ones impress fans and industry alike. If you want club bookers, managers, magazine editors and A&amp;R to notice you then make sure your numbers are up. Web hits, fan group members, online community friends and people on your personal mailing list all add up to your bankability as a band so keep driving those numbers up and watch the doors swing open wide for you. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>4.) Teach, Volunteer, Take Classes, Join Groups&#8212;If you want to meet new people, gain different opportunities, and find fresh ways to obtain your goals, then get out where people are doing what you seek and mingle. If you play and instrument, start teaching and get to know the bands of your students. If you see big events happening in your town, volunteer to work them and get to know the management, talent and audience alike. Take classes and join music organizations not only to learn but to network. There is a whole world of entertainment people out there. Get to know some of them and make those folks a part of your bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s promotional circle. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>By following these tips and others soon you will find that your band is enjoying the opportunities and buzz you were only dreaming of before. Best of all, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re now in charge of your own career and musical destiny; creating profitable situations for yourself. You are playing good shows and coming home with money in your pocket. You are selling your own product to pay for band expenses. You are filling your press kit with reviews, interviews and mentions of your band. You are meeting people and building your mailing list. You are establishing your reputation as an important member of the artistic community. No longer waiting to be thrown a chance by some industry member, you have taken command of your musical destiny and cast yourself as the star of your own show. Now, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you feel better? </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial"><font size="2"></p>
<p>Every musician currently living on the Planet Earth would love nothing more than to wake up tomorrow in the midst of their glorious peak of superstardom. But, as Rome wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t built in a day, neither is the career of any one musician. A musical career is a long, sometimes arduous journey of tiny advances and minor setbacks filling the fragile shell of big breaks and huge disappointments. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s down, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all around and hopefully, as time passes, you can see the course of your career building up slowly through weeks and months and years of steady progress.</p>
<p>But how can you tell if your career is actually going somewhere? How do you know if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re really getting closer to your musical dreams? How can you determine whether or not youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re on the right path? How do you know what to focus on in the immediacy and what paths can be left for another time when you are better equipped to tackle them creatively and concretely? While there is no one set way achieve rock superstardom, the clearest way to realize musical success is to simply set goals.</p>
<p>As mundane as it may seem, setting goals, both long and short-term, for your musical project lends the same kind of structure and discipline to your career that an athlete would use to train for the Olympics. Realistic goals enable you to build your bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s list of accomplishments the way a runner builds his musclesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ pumping up your musical achievements as you lift off the weight of each entertainment roadblock. And the good news is that you can start today. At any time you may put into effect a list of goals, large or small, aimed at boosting your career in any given area.</p>
<p>The following are a few tips that will help you to set some goals so that you may get on your way to achieving all that you want from your music and the entertainment industry in general:</p>
<p>1.) Set Goals You Can Achieve&#8212;Nothing is more depressing for an artist than setting lofty goals for yourself and your music only to bottom out with hopelessness when none of the goals are achieved by the deadline. So, much of what keeps artists plugging away in the industry, against all odds, is the positive re-enforcement of feelings of accomplishment. Keep that upbeat mojo going by setting goals for your band that you can absolutely actualize with lots of elbow grease and some good creative flow. Take a minute to assess each potential achievement and put a realistic time allotment on it so that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re setting yourself up to succeed and move onto the next musical goal.</p>
<p>2.) Keep Your Eyes On The Prize&#8212;ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all well and good to set goals just to see if you can do them, but if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re ultimate goal is to be a big ole humongous rockstar, then try and set goals that will help you on your way to a Rolls Royce, a Bentley and a 2,000 square foot infinity swimming pool. Set a goal to get one article of press each month, to book a decent gig every two weeks, or to update your website daily. Give yourself six months to finish your full-length album, three months to raise the money for your bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s t-shirts or a year to find a good manager to pitch you to labels. Each one of these goals is a great achievement on its own but also an important piece in getting your band where you eventually want it to be. So itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a win/win for your career, any way you slice it, and the feelings of accomplishment will certainly empower you to keep pushing on in the ever-frustrating music business. </p>
<p>3.) One Goal At A Time&#8212;ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s okay to have twenty goals on the table but they should be lined up in order of immediacy and priority so that each one is given their own individual time. Trying to work too many angles at one time may jumble your ability and focus, and leave you at your deadline with six or seven goals only partially achieved. In an industry so dependant on &quot;what have you done lately,&quot; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always a good thing to get a goal completed in a timely manner and move onto the next so that the outside world sees a band that is always accomplishing things, always achieving, and always succeeding. </p>
<p>4.) If At First You DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Succeed&#8212;No matter how hard you try, there will always be goals that elude you past your self-imposed deadline. While itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s good to discipline yourself into a regiment of goal-setting/achieving, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t beat yourself up if circumstances beyond your control lead you to fall short on a deadline or two. The most important thing is that you realize your goal. Secondary to this, is for you to accomplish your goal in a timely fashion. So, put your emphasis on the success and the positive achievement and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t give up on your music and your goal if the deadline rolls around prematurely.</p>
<p>Once you set a line of goals in front of you, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy to focus on achieving rather than worrying about failing. As you begin to achieve goals, you can rely on the confidence of all youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve done and dismiss the angst of worrying about things that havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t happened yet. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never be able to accomplish everything all at once, so why not relish the successes that you can manifest immediately whilst dreaming of the goals you still have yet to achieve. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t waste time. Sit down after you read this and scratch out a list of goals, each with its own timeline. Find something you can accomplish today for your music, something you can get done by tomorrow and something terrific you can nail down by the end of the week. Your band will look better to industry and fans alike and, most importantly, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll look and feel great to yourself and your music. RockSuperstardom awaits! Start knocking back those goals and kick the music biz in the butt, one positive achievement at a time!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><font size="2"></p>
<p>No matter how we, as human beings, live our livesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦drama happens. And the average musician has more drama than the crazy cat lady down the block has bags of used litter on her porch. At every turn, your average wannabe rockstar has a crazy squeeze, a crazier ex, a harem of would-be lovers, and a gaggle of insane stalkers. Then thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the band drama, manager drama, club drama, fan drama, gear drama, and letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not even get started on the online drama potential. Before you know it, your band makes &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; look like 60 Minutes. </p>
<p>Certainly, no one ever said that music was going to be a safe, secure and solid profession to get into. Any industry that pays buckets of money to young, pretty people for jumping around and showing off is bound to inspire zaniness to some degree or another. And the creative process often brings with it a certain amount of tortured genius that fuels the seeds of drama like miracle grow on weeds. Plus, there are more than twenty million musicians around the world that are clamoring for maybe a thousand record deals like contestants on &quot;Survivor&quot; running obstacles courses for a single meager chicken wing. If there was a country built on drama, a musician would be its queen.</p>
<p>However, as much as the music biz is filled with glitz and glamour and the stuff that tabloid headlines are made of, it is also a business. And if thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one thing you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want in the middle of your business, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drama. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a reason why doctors donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fight over dying patients about their golf scores, pilots donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t announce to a plane full of passengers that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been dating the stewardess, and the chef doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come to tell you he forgot to wash his hands before he cooked your four-star mealÃ¢â‚¬Â¦drama does not belong in business. Whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re aspiring to get a record deal or searching for a cure for cancer, leave your drama at home! </p>
<p>The following are a few tips that will help you to navigate the gossip and erratic turbulence of life in the music industry without becoming a slave to your own drama:</p>
<p>1.) DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Let The Internet Suck You In&#8212;Every since the invention of the internet, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been more drama in cyberspace than at a convention for bipolar drag queens. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy to gossip and backbite while you can stay anonymous, so the internet has becoming a breeding ground for anyone and everyone with an agenda, an out-of-control jealousy problem, an axe to grind, or an unbelievable ego. Angry, upset, small-minded people with inferiority complexes like size of Shamu will use the internet to poke at your band with a cyber stick. As hard as it may be, you need to learn to let it all roll off your back. As long as theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re posting about you, it means theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re listening. Removing their inflammatory posts, or replying with similar negativity, feeds the drama until your entire message board is about the trouble-maker on your web site and not your music. What if a potential magazine reviewer or an interested label rep is perusing your page with interest only to find more info about your fight with some internet psycho than about your band? ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not worth risking a loss of opportunity to engage in drama.</p>
<p>2.) Drama DoesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Belong At Your Gigs&#8212;When youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re at a show, your goal is to make music, engage the audience, sell CDs, and win the club over so that you can play there again and again. People make room in their schedules, pay for gas, and fork out cash for a cover charge and bar priced drinks, just to hear you play your songs for them. They want to be entertained; to get away from the pressures of their real lives and escape into the safety and excitement of your music and lyrics. What they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need is more drama at your gigs then they get from their office co-workers, their wacky neighbors, and bully at their kidsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ school combined. Whatever problems youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re having in your personal and professional life, keep it away from your fans and your industry contacts or theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll start to remember your shows more for the drama than for the music. </p>
<p>3.) Your Manager Is Not Your Therapist&#8212;Although a managerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s professional duties make them almost like the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s parent, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t cry to mommy every time the drummer calls you a name or your girlfriend decides she wants to play the field. There is too much music industry drama that your manager has to deal with every day, to add to his/her troubles by piling a heap of your personal woes on top of his/her already overburdened shoulders. If a club owner stiffs you at the door, tell your manager. If another band records one of your songs without permission, tell your manager. If your wife compulsively flashes her breasts at your shows, send her to a therapist, but leave your manager out of it. </p>
<p>4.) Take The Crazymakers Off Your Mailing List&#8212;A lot of damage control can be done simply by eliminating from your mailings the nuts that show up and bring their own boatload of drama. If you know that your ex has never gotten over you, that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s off her meds and that she likes to show up and start swinging at every girl she thinks is catching your eyeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦why would you invite he to your shows? Comb your address book with a big, black sharpie pen and ink out the stalkers, crazies, attention-getters, and overblown drunkards that will turn each and every one of your gigs into a three-ring circus of drama that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re forced to ringmaster from the stage during your set. </p>
<p>Once you remove the drama from your musical career, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find that your gigs go smoother, your website is a more positive place for fans to hang in cyber space, and the industry is less wary about getting behind what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re doing. It may seem silly, but too much drama can often be a warning sign that something is really wrong with a band and you may find that industry types will become gun shy around your band if theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re worried that your reputation as drama queen will be more trouble than itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth. Working in the music business is hard enough. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t give anybody any reason not to work with you. Be smart. Leave your drama at home and show the industry that your music is whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most important to you and your band.</p>

<p>Imagine thisÃ¢â‚¬Â¦youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in the local hospitalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pre-op ward waiting for the removal of your pesky rupturing appendix. You wait and wait in side splitting agony while your doctor chats it up with the nurses, gathering phone numbers from the hot ones. After what seems forever, he gets you prepped and begins the surgery. What should have been a 20-minute procedure turns into two hours. He cracks jokes and talks about his cherry red Ferrari, while youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re lying unconscious with your abdomen split open. Finally, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re sewn up and ready for recovery but super surgeon and his crack anesthesiologist are having a heated discussion about the science of their golf games and have seeming forgotten youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re passed out underneath them with tubes stuck in every orifice. If this were your surgery experience, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d freak out, sue the hospital and your hot-shot doc would wind up cleaning bedpans at the state convalescent hospital. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Sadly, like our skirt-chasing doctor, many musicians think that the consequences of their actions are immaterial and treat their audience with the same lackadaisical disregard that the before-mentioned doctor treated his poor patient with. These selfish creative types show up to gigs late, set up at their own leisure (roughly the same pace that a 100 year-old tortoise would run the Boston marathon), play as long of a set as they please (regardless of their designated set time) and break down/clear the stage at their own whim with little or no regard to the clubÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s schedule. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>However, if you asked any of these artists, they would say that they consider music to be their careerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a career be treated with the same importance and professionalism whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a budding rockstar or an established surgeon? It should, but often itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not and bands then find their reputations are tarnished with labels like: slow, lazy, and irresponsible simply because they seem unable to get their show on (and off) in a timely manner. Get branded as a slovenly flake and watch the music industry folks jump ship faster than the rich ladies on the Titanic. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The following are a few tips that will help you to get up, get on and get off in a timely, professional manner that will impress the powers-that-be and leave you fans wanting more:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>1.) Have Everything Set Up Before You Set Up&#8212;ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not like you just found out you were playing five minutes before. Gigs are booked days, weeks or months in advance so thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no reason not to be well informed and well equipped prior to your arrival and set up. Guitars and drums should be tuned, drum kits and guitar pedals set up and dialed in, and song lists printed and distributed so that set up time is minimal. Once the stage is free, a professional band will simply haul their gear onstage, plug it in, and do a few last minute tweaks before theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re ready to rock and roll. The ancient tortoise rockers, however, will plunk the road cases down on the stage and then force friends, fans and industry alike twiddle their musical thumbs in anticipation while each piece of gear is pulled out, unwrapped, wiped off, place into position and screwed in slowly but surely. Truthfully, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about as interesting as watching paint dry without the guilty pleasure of getting high off the fumes. </p>
<p>2.) Sound Check/Line Check Is Not A Mini Concert&#8212;You may view your sound check as the concert before the concert but youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not making any friends dragging out your sound check to an hour and a half while bands are lined up out the door waiting to set up their own gear and check their sound. Same goes for the line check. You may be surprised to know that audiences arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t all that excited to sit and listen to you work out your live sound in front of their eyes and on their time. Save the lengthy tune-up and checking for the Making Of The Band video. Get your levels quick and get to rockinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢! </p>
<p>3.) Plan Out Your Set Time Well Before Your Set&#8212;The key to a tight set is the prep work that goes on before the night of the gig. Many artists believe that the longer theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re onstage the more the audience gets revved up, but there is something to be said about &quot;too much of a good thing.&quot; Plan out your set, time it and then time it again and make sure that it comes in a few minutes under your designated set list time. Little passive aggressive tricks like cramming in two or three extra songs at the end of the set or coaxing your friends into screaming for an encore only serves to enrage your sound man and confuse your crowd and extensive tuning and chatting amongst yourselves and audience members in between songs is just plain tedious. The tighter your set is the more professional it sounds to the ears of your audience and the happier youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll make your bookers, promoters and club owners. </p>
<p>4.) Tear Down Should Be The Quickest Of All&#8212;If you thought your set up was quick, your bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tear down should be lightning fast in comparison. So much time is wasted every night at a music venue as musicians dawdle after their sets, drinking and chatting with friends, while their gear lies piled up onstage, preventing the next artists from getting set up. Pick up your instruments, haul them of stage, and take them outside or into the green room. There you can wrap your gear up, clean it off, and pack it away into cases and into your cars. Then, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to toss back a few beers and gab with the masses until closing time, without interrupting the flow of the evening.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Imagine thisÃ¢â‚¬Â¦youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in a local club waiting to check out an act your label has sent you to scout. You wait and wait, growing more bored and more drunk while the band youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been sent to see chats it up with the women in the room, giving t-shirts and CDs to the really hot ones. After what seems like forever, the band takes the stage and begins their set. What should have been a 30-minute showcase turns into an hour or more as the band plays a loose set, stopping often to tune, complain about the sound, yell to the bartender for drinks and crack jokes with select audience members; while you sit unimpressed trying to get a feel for the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s style. Finally, their set ends and you wait to approach the band on behalf of your label but these super rockstars are still onstage wrapping up endless cords and wiping down each piece of gear while they chat with each other about how much their set rocked. If this were your A&amp;R experience, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d give up waiting to speak with these lazy musicians, go back to your label and tell them to forget about this particular band and these hot-shot rockstars will wind up working at StarbuckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s until they go on Social Security. This doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to happen to you. Learn to get up, get on and get off. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll soon have the reputation as an easy-to-work-with, professional, reliable band. After all, you never know who might be in the audience to see you on any given night.</p>

<p>You canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t throw a rock in any metropolis on Earth without hitting someone claiming to be a manager. Where musicians go, managers follow. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s as accepted and expected in the entertainment industry as an out-of-control cocaine habit or a failure to pay taxes. When you tell people youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a musician, one of the first things theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to ask you is: Do you have a manager? However, those in the throws of the music business know to ask an even more accurate question: Do you have a good manager? </p>
<p>&quot;WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the difference?&quot; you may ask. IsnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t any manager better than no manager at all? While it would seem that the answer to that question is unequivocally, &quot;Yes&quot;, in reality itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a bit like asking, &quot;IsnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t having a herpes-ridden prostitute for a girlfriend better than being single?&quot; In truth, bad representation is far worse than a lack of representation. While, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a fact, that there are things your band will probably never achieve without the aid of a manager, agent, entertainment attorney, etc., bad representation can stagnate a careerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦stop it dead in its hurling climb to the ranks of superstardom or even worseÃ¢â‚¬Â¦undo some of the hard work the band has already done.</p>
<p>Sad but true, a bad manager can take a perfectly good band and turn them into a thing so foul that old gypsy women covering their faces with rags will spit and give your band the evil eye as you pass. Ok, that may be a bit dramatic, but seriouslyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦all your band really has is its name and its reputation, so why would take a chance on either of those by putting the whole of your band into the hands of someone that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not 100% sure has your best interests at stake?</p>
<p>The following are a few tips that will help you to decipher whether or not your manager can take you to the top or turn your band into a flop:</p>
<p>1.) The DrummerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Girlfriend Is Not A Manager&#8212;Sure, she may get names for your mailing list, invite her girlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beach volleyball team to all of your gigs and post your latest pictures on your website photo gallery, but sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not really your manager. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a helper, she can be the president of your fan club, the head of your street team and the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sexiest roadie but she probably doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know how to put together a press package and make the calls that will get you into an A&amp;R repÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s office for a meeting. This also applies to: boyfriends, wives, husbands, booty calls, one night stands, moms, dads, cousins, aunts, uncles, neighbors, nieces, nephews, grandparents, grandchildren, pets and the homeless guy who roots through your trash at midnight. These people may all be well-meaning and you can accept their aid in dozens of ways (it takes a village to build a popular unsigned band) but donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t give them the label or the powers of a manager. </p>
<p>2.) Treasure Your Fans But DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Let Them Manage You&#8212;This should be a given but youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be surprised how many over-eager, slightly-obsessed fans move from semi-stalker to mega-manager in a few simple weeks. I cannot stress how simply wrong this entire concept is for two dozen major reasons the most important of which is: fans need to be kept at a distance. There is a reason why that same person comes to all of your shows no matter how many you play, gets there early, sits up front seemingly paralyzed starring at you enraptured. Either theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in love with someone in the band or theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re insane. These may be reasons to get a restraining order but certainly not reasons to make someone your manager. A bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s manager knows every secret of each musician, every person in each memberÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal life, where you keep your money, where you live, and whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in your fan/contact database. This is not information that you want someone who has 450 cut-out pictures of you on their bedroom ceiling having at his/her disposal. Enough said?</p>
<p>3.) DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Sign A Contract Unless ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Worth It&#8212;ManagerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like control. That why they choose to be managers and not people who macramÃƒÂ© wall hangings with the mane hair of ponies. Thus, most managers will try and evoke you into signing a contract. In the entertainment industry, contracts are like marriage certificatesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦before you sign one be sure your band wants to be tied to the same person for long time (a year, two years, five years, etc.) because theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re much easier to get into than to get out of. For example, if you sign a contract with an efficient, but somewhat green manager, who is helping all he/she can to get you everything possible from what little resources he/she has and then Gwen StefaniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s management team approaches you after a big gig and wants to put you on tour with John Mayer. Do you think if you tell them, &quot;We love to take your tour but weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re under contract with someone else for the next five years, can you hit us up then?&quot; the offer will still stand? Not so much. So, if you must sign contracts, keep them short and make sure they give you room to act, think, play and communicate with others without getting clearance from your band warden (manager). And make it includes an exit clause. Read up on it.</p>
<p>4.) Sometimes Bigger Is Not Better&#8212;Although itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a huge ego stroke to brag to all of the other musicians backstage at the Whiskey A Go-Go that your manager works with Grammy award-winners and stadium sell-outs, sometimes an unsigned band can get lost in a huge management firm. While Mr. Big Stud Manager is busy picking out MadonnaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dress for the American Music Awards, he may forget to ask Quincy Jones to attend your bass playerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s birthday gig at Billy-Bob WangÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tofu BBQ Shack. The problem with huge managers is that their focus often goes the acts that are making them 15% of 100 million dollars a year. Your 15% of $45.75 a year after expenses is probably not his highest priority now or ever, and what good are his super amazing industry contacts if he never remembers to invite them to your gigs?</p>
<p>Having a manager is great but only if they provide more benefit to the band than the sum total of your band members and band helpers can do for yourselves. If you find someone who can open doors, take your music places it cannot go on its on and has your best intentions at heart, then grab that contract, sign it and enjoy the benefits. If not, you may find yourself: conned, stalked, ignored and/or legally bound to someone that puts their own agenda (well-meaning or otherwise) and their own ego above whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right for you band. And whatever you do, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sit around waiting for Mr./Ms. Right to wisk your band off its feet and carry it off on his/her white horse to the Fairyland where everyone gets a record deal. You, as its members, know more than anyone, how to do whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right for your band and nothing will attract the perfect manager faster than seeing musicians who are out there, doing their thing, and making headway in a very difficult business with a great attitude and terrific music. </p>
