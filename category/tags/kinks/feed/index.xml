										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Active from 1964-1967, this North English combo deserve more than its &#8221; Lemmy Kilmeister&#8217;s first band&#8221; footnote. With their taut 40-minute sets and clerical airs, they were favorites of the Northern dance club scene, though the lack of original material limited their options. A late move to London to record for Shel Talmy didn&#8217;t change the world, though theirs&#8217; surely turned more moddish and they found hipper writers to cover. The band&#8217;s appealing confidence shows in the title track, a startling rearrangement of the Who&#8217;s then-unreleased &#8220;The Kids Are Alright&#8221; replete with tinkling keys and falsetto call-and-response vocals, and on the irresistibly twitchy &#8220;Say Mama.&#8221; Stay tuned till the closer, &#8220;Little Rosy,&#8221; an unreleased Ray Davies tune performed with properly Kinksy abandon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the great things about collecting rock and roll music is that there is always an undiscovered gem lacking from your collection just waiting for you to discover. This year (2005) celebrates the 30th year that I have been such a music junkie. LOST IN THE GROOVES is a book that celebrates albums that fell through the cracks in the &#8220;classics&#8221; description. Included are albums that: might have sold well initially but are now pretty much ignored (&#8220;McCartney II&#8221;), works by artists that were not taken seriously at the time (Herman&#8217;s Hermits, etc), obscure artists of merit, and generally lost gems that demand reevaluation.</p>
<p>I had quite a few of the discs mentioned such as: &#8220;Muswell Hillbillies&#8221;, &#8220;No Dice&#8221;, &#8220;Klaatu&#8221;, &#8220;L.A. (Light Album)&#8221;, &#8220;McCartney II&#8221;, &#8220;Subterranean Jungle&#8221;, &#8220;Face Dances&#8221;, &#8220;Pacific Ocean Blue&#8221;, &#8220;Hillbilly Deluxe&#8221; &#8211; just to name a few. But, I found many more that I now need to hear! I only take issue with one entry: Pink Floyds&#8217; &#8220;The Final Cut&#8221;. I bought it when it first came out and 20+ years later still say its crap!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already given LOST IN THE GROOVES several readings and, armed with a yellow highlighter, have made note of which albums I need to add to my collection. This is the perfect book for the advanced record collector/music fan! (Ronnie, Ear Candy)</p>
