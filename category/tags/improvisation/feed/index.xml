										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">As a completely live and improvisational recording with spoken word by Alex Caldiero and the accompaniment of 5-piece cello/bass/drums/slide-guitar/keyboard combo Theta Naught, Disc 1 is good to listen to at night when you feel like being at a jazz joint or a coffeehouse but you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to have to leave the house. <span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">How Long Did It Last?</span><span> is my favorite track, track 8, and that may be because by then the performance collaborations between music and poetry has finally stewed to just the right temperature for all the songs on the rest of the disc. Or, because by then my ears and mind have finally tuned to the proper channels for the attentive listening this record deserves. Disc 2 is an instrumental bonus disc that is on the same expressive ambient music plane. After being inspired by the voice of Alex Caldiero, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fun to listen to and decide what words it makes me want to say.</span></p>
