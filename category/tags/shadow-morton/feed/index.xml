<blockquote>
<p class="int"><em><strong>MW:</strong> I did purchase a gun once, a little Derringer. I bought a gun after somebody tried to break into my hotel room. There were these glass panels on the side of the door and all of a sudden I see this arm coming through. Not only was I scared to death, but there were large amounts of money in the room. You&#8217;re on the road with no protection. But, I was a little kid. I didn&#8217;t know. Back then, you could walk in anywhere and buy a gun. But the FBI came to my mother&#8217;s house and said, &quot;Will you please tell your daughter she&#8217;ll be arrested if she gets off the plane with her gun?&quot; We just finished a tour in Florida and I turned it in at the police station down there.</em></p>
