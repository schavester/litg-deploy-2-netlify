<p>Those sophomore 12-inches from Frank and his Mothers are, I&rsquo;m afraid, just too easily overlooked and unheard, stretching as they do between the twin monumental peaks of <a href="/?p=374" target="_self"><strong><em>Freak Out</em></strong></a> and <a href="/?p=793" target="_self"><strong><em>We&rsquo;re Only In It For The Money</em></strong></a>.&nbsp; But in rear-view, I posit that spiffy little long-player known as <a href="https://www.united-mutations.com/z/frank_zappa/zappa002.htm" target="_self"><strong><em>Absolutely Free</em></strong></a>, recorded in a mere twenty-five hours circa 11/66, reveals itself to be, maybe, <em>just maybe</em>, the man&rsquo;s true whacked masterpiece.</p>
<p>Two vinyl-side-long suites examining the festered underbelly of LBJ&rsquo;s America, its ragged overall sheen of wise-ass vocals and hot-rawk jamming may indeed lure the listener in for Just Another Boogie From L.A., granted.&nbsp; But as no less an expert on the subject as original Mother <a href="https://donprestonmusic.com/" target="_self"><strong>Don Preston</strong></a> has since revealed, much of <em>Absolutely Free</em> was in fact painstakingly rehearsed and recorded in intricate four-and-eight-bar sections requiring dozens of takes apiece, and the music itself was just as comfortable quoting Stravinsky as it was the Supremes, Kingsmen, and/or the band&rsquo;s beloved vegetable-encrusted doo-wop.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Also, this record just happens to contain the legendary original appearance of &ldquo;Brown Shoes Don&rsquo;t Make It&rdquo; which, if I may be so bold, absolutely eats Pete Townshend&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Quick One While He&rsquo;s Away&rdquo; in the mod mini-opera department.</p>
<p>But finally, take one quick listen to &ldquo;Why Don&rsquo;tcha Do Me Right,&rdquo; the band&rsquo;s 1967 non-hit single included as an <em>Absolutely Free</em> bonus track, and find yourself agreeing with <em>Negative Dialectics of Poodle Play</em> Zappauthor Ben Watson when he claims that had The Mothers released only <a href="https://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_covers/1023/cover_11258642009.jpg" target="_self"><strong>a rare seven-inches</strong></a> or two or three like this back in the daze, then duly disappeared, they&rsquo;d be widely hailed today as one of the world&rsquo;s most wholly <em>Nugget</em>-worthy Garage Rock Wonders.&nbsp; Excuse me while I call Little Steven&rsquo;s radio show with a request&hellip;..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>PS:&nbsp; Quiz Time, boys and girls!</p>
<p>Which future member of none other than Monty Python made his audio debut on Side Two of <em>Absolutely Free</em> ??</p>
<p>First correct response wins an all-expense-paid trip as the first member of the Peace Corps to be sent to Alabama, as The Big Surfer would say&hellip;..</strong></a></p>
