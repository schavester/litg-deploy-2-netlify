										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to our generous pals at <a href="http://125records.com/" target="_blank">125 Records</a>, we have a limited number of copies of the brand new and wonderful Loud Family with Anton Barbeau CD <em>What If It Works?</em>, each one cleverly autographed by Anton and LF mainstay Scott Miller, available as a free premium for folks purchasing a retroactive subscription for $23 US, $34 overseas. A retroactive subscription consists of any four recent issues of Scram, sent all at once with your free CD, and represents a weird warpage of time and space through which you can approximate the experience of having been a subscriber all this time.</p>
<p>Interested? Then <a href="http://litg.richardschave.com//feedback" target="_self">email</a> me to confirm we still have CDs, and once one is being held for you I will follow up with payment instructions. For more info on the available back issues, read on&#8230; </p>
