										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ai to the yai yai, it&#8217;s my first Blog posting! Will it get me work? Is it supposed to be informal? My foot&#8217;s asleep so that&#8217;s an affirmative  sign in regards to my last question.<br />
I reside in Vancouver, BC and often get asked to contribute to a free music rag here called The Nerve, especially lately as  they know that I am currently spending my time waiting between employment insurance cheques. The music editor is an exceedingly charming British ex-pat of exceptional taste, which  makes it rather difficult to say &#8220;No&#8221; even when it means &#8220;No.&#8221; What follows are two reviews that I recently wrote for this publication. The first review of the Queen DVD is self-explanatory (except to say that White Rock is an all too  real suburb located just outside Vancouver where Paul Rodgers really does live). The second is a fake review of a non-existent band. In a way this band, Sourkraut Sunset,  does exist as they are a glib pastiche of what is currently &#8220;hot&#8221; in the International Critics&#8217; Corner regarding the Vancouver music scene. Discussion to follow.</p>
