<p>The Deadbeat Poets will be playing this year&#8217;s SXSW Festival at:<br />
Lambert&#8217;s Patio<br />
401 W. 2nd St.<br />
Austin, Texas</p>
<p>The band goes on at 9:00 pm Thursday, March 13th.<br />
More info on the Deadbeat Poets at:<br />

<p>About The Deadbeat Poets<br />
The Deadbeat Poets were formed in Youngstown, Ohio in the summer of 2006. The band consists of veteran Ohio musicians with eclectic credentials: Frank Secich (Blue Ash, Club Wow, Stiv Bators Band), Terry Hartman (Backdoor Men, Napoleon In Rags, Terry &#038; The Tornadoes), Pete Drivere (Infidels, Pretty Demons) and John Koury (Infidels, Slackjaw). Their debut album (which was recorded over the first few months of 2007 at Youngstown&#8217;s Ampreon Recorder) is now available on Pop Detective Records in America &#038; in Japan on Vivid Sound Records. Also, making guest appearances on the album are Bill &#8220;Cupid&#8221; Bartolin on guitar and Chris Leonardi on piano and organ. </p>
<p>Soon, you&#8217;ll be able to sit back and relax (pop the top and set the sail) as the Deadbeat Poets take you on a timely journey. To such places&#8230;. romantic places like Beaver Falls (via Mahoningtown) you&#8217;ll go. You&#8217;ll travel to the exotic northside of Youngstown, Cleveland, the depths of the Atlantic Ocean, Toronto, Geneva-On-The-Lake, New York, LA, London, the far reaches of outer space, Paris, Mt. Pilot, The Bering Sea, St. Paul and of course Buffalo, NY. You&#8217;ll meet fun lovin&#8217;, sex-crazed aliens in &#8220;The Truth About Flying Saucers&#8221;. You&#8217;ll hear the tale of the legendary Ray Robinson who once roamed the dark, back-country roads of Western, PA in &#8220;The Green Man&#8221;. You&#8217;ll encounter semi-romantic mountain men and their passions in &#8220;Ernest T&#8221; and ride along with Stiv Bators as he once terrorized the western world in &#8220;The Stiv Bators Ghost Tour&#8221;. You&#8217;ll find out the connection between Ernest Hemmingway and Gertrude Stein and French bidets in &#8220;Where Was I When I Needed Me?&#8221;. You&#8217;ll raise glasses and bottles with the lads in &#8220;No Island Like The Mind, No Ship Like Beer&#8221; and be sadly disappointed by gangsters and thieves as &#8220;The Goody Wagon&#8221; never arrives. If floating in a psychedelic flutter is your inclination then &#8220;What Part Of Cognitive Dissonance Don&#8217;t You Understand?&#8221; will probably be your cup of tea. Then again, you may find that after all of this &#8230;..well that &#8220;It&#8217;s Nothing&#8221; to you. Then again, you may start getting &#8220;A Funny Little Feeling&#8221; that you will enjoy the Deadbeat Poets. </p>
