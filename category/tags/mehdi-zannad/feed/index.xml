<p>Fugu <em>Fugu EP</em> (Semantic, 1996)  </p>
<p>Fugu is Mehdi Zannad, a classically trained French pianist who discovered he could only compose three-minute songs. Don&rsquo;t be fooled by the indie world that tries to &ldquo;Hello Kitty-ize&rdquo; him. However pretentious Zannad&rsquo;s titles, his music could be taken seriously by the sternest scholars. This self-released EP, which predates debut full-length Fugu 1 by four years, is as despicably rare as it is charming. I was able to obtain a copy directly from Zannad after a Boston performance. His jaw-dropping postmodern Beach Boys deconstructions (complete with four-part harmonies) combined with skillful power pop spelunking led me to confront his timid frame after the set and proclaim, &ldquo;you are my new favorite band!&rdquo; More consistent and battier than Fugu 1, the EP is one of the least boring and most rococo recordings you are ever likely to hear. &ldquo;F29&rdquo; is a trip into a cavern of multi-colored rock candy stalagmites triggered by swift piano arpeggios, skronky Vox organ hits, sweeping cello melodramas and Zannad&rsquo;s own incoherent trilling. Complete with sighing violins, &ldquo;F4&rdquo; evokes a mythological place where the Beatles are composed of two French Paul McCartneys, the Velvet Underground&rsquo;s Sterling Morrison plays his ultra simplistic &ldquo;non-rock&rdquo; leads, and Ringo pats on the muted snare, like on Abbey Road&rsquo;s &ldquo;Something.&rdquo; On &ldquo;Untitled&rdquo; and &ldquo;Interlude,&rdquo; a cacophony of voices and bubbling machines intermingle with gurgling horns and myriad symphonic cutting-room floor clippings before returning to Earth. &ldquo;F26&rdquo; pits the thrush of strummed guitars, frowning horns and cotton candy organ against Zannad&rsquo;s voice on the odd-canticle chorus. While it&rsquo;s possible to be swept up in the obvious magical mystery of his production, or the fractured-ness of his arranging sensibility, there is always at the core an essential song, a framework to shake you of your every sun-baked boredom with pop music. Orgiastic, steeped in utter coherence. (Jonathan Donaldson, from the book <em>Lost in the Grooves</em>) </p>
