<p>The Lipstick Killers <em>Mesmerizer</em> (Citadel, Australia, 1984)  </p>
<p>On the strength of a Deniz Tek-produced 45 issued by Bomp subsidiary Voxx in 1979, Sydney&rsquo;s Lipstick Killers decamped for Los Angeles and dreams of Northern hemisphere success. They lasted a year in the cozy grime of the Tropicana Motel and a bug-infested Silverlake apartment, playing about a dozen gigs, including a Brian Jones memorial at the Whisky and at Madame Wong&rsquo;s with the Plimsouls. Mesmerizer is the document of one of these shows, recorded on cassette by Flesh Eater Chris D., cleaned up nicely and released posthumously on Radio Birdman crony &ldquo;Brother&rdquo; John Needham&rsquo;s Citadel imprint. In the absence of an official studio album, this high energy set stands as slightly sloppy but irresistible evidence of the band&rsquo;s magic. Over twelve songs, including terrific covers of the Chocolate Watchband&rsquo;s &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Talk About Girls&rdquo; and the Elevators&rsquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve Got Levitation,&rdquo; the Lipstick Killers swagger like the Hindu gods of their signature song, all power chords, tribal drums and perfectly controlled frenzy. The band&rsquo;s originals come across like unknown frat rock standards gene-spliced with a finely honed blend of psychedelia and DIY punk energy. Insinuation was their strong suit: &ldquo;Dying Boy&rsquo;s Crawl&rdquo; and &ldquo;Strange Flash&rdquo; get right under your skin and pull you bodily towards the music. Maybe a band this tight and moody was nothing special on the Sydney scene, but they must have blown their L.A. competition sideways. Unfortunately, the usual band problems intruded&#8211;mental illness, money, the singer getting a day job to pay rent on the communal flat&#8211;and the Killers called it quits. The members eventually wound their way back to Australia, where they still occasionally play as the Lipstick Killers. When I saw them open for Radio Birdman in 2002 they fulfilled every promise of <em>Mesmerizer</em> and more. (Kim Cooper, from the book <em>Lost in the Grooves</em>)  </p>
