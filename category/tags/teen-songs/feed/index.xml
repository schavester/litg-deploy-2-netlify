<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><img loading="lazy" style="width: 133px; height: 133px" src="https://www.robhegel.com/images/196_hegel.gif" alt="Rob Hegel" title="Rob Hegel" width="133" height="133" align="right" />Forget albums, CDs, or artists. Sometimes all you need to make a definitive statement is a single song.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Rob Hegel</strong> did just that in the summer of 1980 with a hilariously scandalous soap opera of a pop song called <strong>Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tommy, Judy &amp; Me.Ã¢â‚¬Â</strong> Crass, crude and unforgettably catchy, it embodied the 1980s teen zeitgeist before there was such a thing. Problem was, teen movies, not teen-themed songs, were popular in the 1980s. So HegelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s adolescent opus stalled out at #109 on BillboardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bubbling Under chart and was swiftly forgotten.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tommy, Judy &amp; MeÃ¢â‚¬Â tackles the sticky topic of teen sex. A lot of people discover sex in high school; what Makes Hegel unique is that he penned a tune that vividly commemorates every perverse feeling and social interaction relating to the topic. He throws in characters weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d soon see on the big screen: a tuff chick, a would-be cool dude, and a nerdy antihero.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Hegel was a songwriter who co-wrote Air SupplyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hit Ã¢â‚¬Å“Take Me as I Am,Ã¢â‚¬Â and penned much of the score to a 1970s Saturday morning TV show called Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Kids From C.A.P.E.R.Ã¢â‚¬Â Nothing in his resume pointed to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tommy, Judy &amp; Me,Ã¢â‚¬Â though. The title alone lets you know for the get-go that this is no Ã¢â‚¬Å“boy meets girlÃ¢â‚¬Â story. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more like: Boy gets lousy sex advice from a friend, gets the girl anyway, then learns said friend is a lair. And impotent. Forget New Order &#8212; this is one really bizarre love triangle.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The music sounds like a cross between The Cars and late period Styx. But the song stands out because of its semi-spoken, semi-obscene verses (where Hegel seeks advice from Tommy) and singalong chorus. When Hegel sing to Judy that Ã¢â‚¬Å“heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to know herÃ¢â‚¬Â and her comely reply is that she Ã¢â‚¬Å“only likes what she hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t done twice.Ã¢â‚¬Â John Hughes couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have written it better.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">H</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">ad anyone heard it, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tommy, Judy and MeÃ¢â‚¬Â might have been labeled offensive. But whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most shocking now is how the song casually prophesizes the Columbine school shootings. In verse two, Tommy says heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“bought a gun and that one day theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll remember his name.Ã¢â‚¬Â To which Hegel distractedly responds: Ã¢â‚¬Å“LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s change the subject, Tommy, letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s talk of Judy.Ã¢â‚¬Â See how no one takes the time to listen to troubled teens?</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Even with its oddball outrageousness, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tommy, Judy &amp; MeÃ¢â‚¬Â works because it captures the anxiety-riddled vibe of teendom. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s awkward, embarrassing, immature, and sometimes totally phony. Just teen life like the real world.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Ã¢â‚¬Å“<em>Tommy, Judy &amp; MeÃ¢â‚¬Â was released as RCA single #12009. Blog entry originally posted 3/16/06.</em></font></font></p>
