										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why does the movie &#8220;Sir Henry At Rawlinson End&#8221; get such a bad rap amongst average film goers and even some die hard Bonzo Dog Band fans alike? (tho it was well received critically upon release)<br />
Being a huge fan of Vivian Stanshall, he&#8217;s one of my Personal Style Gods, I went into this hard to find film suitably wary, yet left thinking that this is a perfect cinematic hallmark of whom some call the last of the British Eccentrics.<br />
Everyone in the room of fifteen people that I was in truly enjoyed this movie and some had never even heard of Vivian Stanshall.<br />
Who was Vivian Stanshall? Impossible to encapsulate. Moustachioed drinking buddy of Keith Moon and member of The Beatles&#8217; favourite band The Bonzo Dog Band. I regard The Bonzos as the greatest rock band of all time. Yes, they were funny but they were also nuanced and handy with a ballad, truly witty and catchy songsmiths that made things explode onstage. Their pastiches and wild dandyisms predated glam.<br />
(Just read a great quote in a 1973 ish of Creem yesterday that really helps to solidify this theory: &#8220;Melody Maker&#8217;s Chris Welch is probably right when he says that if they had stuck together a few more months, they would have been the kings of Glam-rock. That&#8217;s the breaks.&#8221;<br />
VIVIAN STANSHALL:<br />

<p>Stanshall later created a certain mythology around a mad aristocratic family that meandered in a crumbling castle named Rawlinson End. Representing the hazy decline of The British empire that he performed as radio plays regularly on John Peel&#8217;s show.<br />
The movie was written by Stanshall who also plays a small role. One may recognize some familar faces if you&#8217;ve seen a few British films&#8230;<br />
No real rising or falling action, it&#8217;s just a strange snapshot of ghost exorcisms, prisoners of war on the manor, etcetera, there is a plot or few in there! Incredibly witty, many of us wanted to view it again to catch all of the jokes and goings on. &#8220;If I had all the money I&#8217;d spent on drink I&#8217;d spend it on drink!&#8221; Utterly loony.<br />
This movie is completely unmarketable and delightful. A perfect visual representation of the Rawlinson End mythos.<br />
When the director was asked why he filmed it entirely in sepiatone he didn&#8217;t reply. The answer is obvious.<br />
Reccommended for fans of Guy Maddin and fans of British comedy of which this should be placed highly in the pantheon of.<br />
