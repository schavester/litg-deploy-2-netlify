<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It starts off innocently enough. A simmering bass line commences, followed by a mid-tempo drum beat and some leads that could almost have come from a Byrds record. But as soon as the lead singer Jeff Mentges begins to talk Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and not sing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ over the din, you known youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in for something way different.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The record is <strong>Ã¢â‚¬Å“Teen LoveÃ¢â‚¬Â</strong> by the Maryland hardcore band No Trend, which achieved a degree of cult popularity in the early 1980s. Released in the heyday of MTV ascension, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Teen LoveÃ¢â‚¬Â spit in the face of mass media-induced conformity with its deadpan dissection of youth culture.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ã¢â‚¬Å“They met during social interaction in Algebra class,Ã¢â‚¬Â the song begins. Ã¢â‚¬Å“She was expressionless at first, but then smiled to indicate submission. He rearranged his facial features to appear friendly.Ã¢â‚¬Â</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This is the tone Mentges takes and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s both hilarious and a bit disconcerting. The song goes on to skewer just about every facet of teen culture then wraps up with a gruesome ending right of all those Ã¢â‚¬Å“teen tragedyÃ¢â‚¬Â song from the early 1960s.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ã¢â‚¬Å“Teen LoveÃ¢â‚¬Â is hardcore in attitude more than sound (except for the hyped-up middle section). The song was the highlight of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut release, a four-song EP, released in 1983 on the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own label. The EPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s other three songs are pretty decent hardcore rave-ups, so itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth tracking down on vinyl. No Trend went on to record until 1988, eventually moving to Touch &amp; Go Records.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ã¢â‚¬Å“Teen LoveÃ¢â‚¬Â was no doubt more popular in my neck of the woods because there area I lived as a teen was two towns down from where No Trend was from Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ashton, Md. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the song got a lot of play on the local alternative radio station. At the time Ashton was a tiny, rural area (itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s since been built up), and I remember being surprised the band wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t from L.A. or D.C. (the two hardcore hubs of the early 1980s).</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The only other thing I should mention is that my then-girlfriend found this song, like, totally offensive and really hated the ending. She used to threaten to leave whenever I would break out the EP. So there you have it: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Teen LoveÃ¢â‚¬Â almost ruined my teen love. What better recommendation could you want?</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><em><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">No TrendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Teen LoveÃ¢â‚¬Â can be found on Teen Beat RecordsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Teen Love: The Early Years.Ã¢â‚¬Â Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYX9MzN4JTg" title="No Trend - Teen Love">YouTube.</a></font></font></em></p>
