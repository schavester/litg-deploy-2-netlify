<p>Review:<br /> John Trubee and the Ugly Janitors of America <em>The Communists Are Coming to Kill Us!</em>  (Enigma, 1984)  </p>
<p>Mr. Trubee is best known as the man behind &ldquo;Blind Man&rsquo;s Penis,&rdquo; a demented poem with lines like &ldquo;Warts love my nipples because they are pink/Vomit on me baby, yeah, yeah&rdquo; that was sent to a song-poem mill and turned into a deadpan country song which subsequently became an underground novelty hit. Lesser known, but far stranger, is his follow-up album. Trubee got the ball rolling by sending a fake suicide note to several associates, including L.A. Reader rock critic Matt Groening and Enigma&rsquo;s Bill Hein, who agreed to meet with Trubee and negotiate a record deal. In Trubee&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;It was no negotiation. I wanted to do the record badly&#8211;that was obvious. It was similar to a horny teenage boy negotiating with a supermodel to lose his virginity. There is no deal&#8211;he just gets with her fast before she changes her mind. I told Bill I&#8217;d do it for no money. He set up mastering time at Capitol and I walked in &hellip; with a brown paper bag full of reel tapes and cassettes of teenage poetry rants, prank phone calls, aborted horn chart recordings from music school, and other weirdness. I had the flu and I sat with Eddie Shierer for six hours editing all this madness into an album.&rdquo; What resulted was an extremely unique and, well, odd record. I came across it in a used bin shortly after it came out. It was both annoying as hell and insanely captivating, a collage of atonal avant-jazz, primitive electronic compositions, and spoken rants against stuck-up college girls and the suave men who slept with them, plus those juvenile prank calls, a revelation long before the genre became a pop cultural phenomena. If the record that was attached to the Voyager space probe had contained the sounds of all the alienated, pissed-off, shat-on people on earth, it would sound something like this. (Chas Glynn, from the book <em>Lost in the Grooves</em>) </p>
