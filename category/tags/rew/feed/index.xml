Black Flamingo, Flack Blamingo (!!), RewBee, RewWalsh and/or, on her latest digital five inches of self-styled &ldquo;punktry&rdquo; music called <em>*that*S*rite*</em>, just plain <a href="https://www.luvrew.com/" target="_self"><strong>Rew</strong></a>, the jewel of NYC I know as Lisa Ludwig truly is the l-u-v child Ronnie Spector and Patti Smith SHOULD&rsquo;VE had.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Chock straight full up of her very own grand brand of supremely potty-mouthed pop (i.e.: &ldquo;U Suck&rdquo; &hellip;&rdquo;dirty&rdquo; version especially) and powered by the ever-percussive spirit of no less than Our Friend Ficca (as in Billy, of Television, Waitresses, <a href="https://www.tomlou.com/rave.html" target="_self"><strong>Dave Rave Conspiracy</strong></a> et al deserved fame) Rew sweetly took the time to answer, for us all, once and for all&hellip;..</p>
<p>1. <strong>Munsters or Addams Family:&nbsp; Which one&#8217;s for you, and why?</strong></p>
<p>I secretly alwayz wanted to be Wednesday &#8230;the Addams were always so classy &amp; BLACK&#8230;my favorite color&#8230;&#8230;.but in real life herman munster lived on my street &amp; i use to hang at their house&#8230;sometimez&#8230;my brother&#8217;s babysat for the kids..i wanted to but i was too young&#8230;the house was kind of creepy&#8230;but they were really kool &amp; eccentric&#8230;they had pugs{dogs} everywhere&#8230;&amp; NO rules&nbsp; &#8230;cobwebs everywhere&#8230;art everywhere&#8230;it was very surreal&#8230;we alwyaas thought it was a modern day muensters&#8230;cause it was in color!!!</p>
<p>2. <strong>Who in the world, living or dead, would you most like to play a game of Twister with?</strong></p>
<p>john john kennedy</p>
<p>3. <strong>How many Sid King &amp; The Five Strings records do you own?</strong></p>
<p>ummmm&#8230;.who?&#8230;but i do luv texas!!!&#8230;all my records got soaked up in a flood while i was out of town once a few years back&#8230;the albums actually saved my apartment by absorbing all the water&#8230;thank heaven for cardboard&#8230;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <strong>If you had been working the front gate at the Dakota that night back in 1980 when nasty Mark David Chapman showed up, pistol in hand, to avenge the chief Beatle for his &quot;bigger than Jesus&quot; wisecrack, what would you have done?</strong></p>
<p>seduce him in any way possible&#8230;&amp; then spin him around by his hair like a lasso until his eyes popped out of his head &amp; then leave him until he could see again cause i think his vision was gone to begin with along w/ his mind so i guess he&#8217;d still be lying there&#8230;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; <strong>&quot;Gilligan&quot; or &quot;The Professor&quot;:&nbsp; Which one&rsquo;s for you,&nbsp; and for How Long?</strong></p>
<p>i do luv getting into trouble so i guess i have to pick gilligan cause he is alwayz getting into trouble &amp; the professor would always be getting out of trouble&#8230;&amp; who needs that?&nbsp; gilligan would probably get me so crazy too..&amp; i luv crazy&#8230;just pissing me off &amp; making me laugh&#8230; how long&#8230;well would we still be on the island??<br />it is Gilligan&#8217;s Island&nbsp; so i&#8217;ll stay forever cause maybe he&#8217;s the King by now &amp; that would make me the Queen&#8230;rite???&nbsp; we&#8217;d be royalty&#8230;</p>
<p>6. <strong>What single song, living or dead, do you most wish you&#8217;d written&#8230; and why didn&#8217;t you?</strong></p>
<p>it would have to be the R KELLY &#8216;Trapped in the Closet&quot; opera&#8230;cause damn..that is the longest single i ever heard..&amp; you can never ever believe all the twists &amp; turns that go on &amp; the brilliant writing&#8230;it&#8217;s pure crazy entertainment &amp; pure genius&#8230;.i didn&#8217;t write it cause as twisted as some may believe i am ,i am an innocent baby next to this man&#8217;s imagination&#8230;or experience&#8230;</p>
<p>7. <strong>Whose heart-shaped, purple guitar would you most like to be reincarnated as?</strong></p>
<p>funny i have a heart shaped purple guitar&#8230;but i sure would LUV PRINCE having it &amp; playing it&#8230;if it were me!..i know he&#8217;d treat me rite&#8230;</p>
<p>8. <strong>In 2000 words or less, your hopes, aspirations and goals, musical or otherwise, for your life and your country?</strong></p>
