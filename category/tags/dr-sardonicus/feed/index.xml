										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8230; A month or two after I finished Kill Your Idols, I discovered another recent book, Lost in the Grooves (edited by Kim Cooper and David Smay), almost by accident. If upending the rock canon is a worthy goal, this book has the approach I like: positive, off center, championing the underdog even when he turns out to be Paul McCartney. The book is a series of capsule reviews of uncelebrated favorites, and although the pick with which I agree most, Spirit&#8217;s Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus, isn&#8217;t all that obscure (it went gold, after all), more than half of the book is stuff I&#8217;ve never heard of at all. There&#8217;s a bit of the anti-canon thing &ndash; Jim O&#8217;Rourke writes that he&#8217;d rather hear about Sparks&#8217;s Propaganda than Pet Sounds, but, to balance that out, I can&#8217;t help being amused by O&#8217;Rourke&#8217;s comment that &quot;Propaganda is the standard to which I hold myself and everything else.&quot; (Imaginary dialogue: &quot;Well, Jeff, I guess A Ghost Is Born is shaping up pretty well. But it&#8217;s no Propaganda.&quot;)&#8230; (Patrick Buzby, Jambands.com)</p>
