										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>  Yes, me again! Back so soon with real groovy tunes so grabs ya a spoon and start digging in! </p>
<p>  Fans of &#8217;60&#8217;s British garage pop and R&#038;B have no doubt heard of the great band The Action (and if you haven&#8217;t, check them out now!!!) so those fans will no doubt be thrilled when they find out The Action morphed and became a totally different band at one point.</p>
<p>  Below is a review of Sunbeam&#8217;s recent reissue of one of the best of The Action&#8217;s post-Action albums.</p>
<p>Mighty Baby &#8211; A Jug Of Love<br />
Sunbeam Records</p>
<p>  Thanks to the great, great Sunbeam label we can again enjoy the thrilling psychedelic sounds of one of the most overlooked psychedelic bands ever to arise out of England. I, for one, have been waiting for this album to be reissued for a mighty (baby) long time! This reissue of this underrated band&#8217;s second album from 1972 is like manna from the heavens for those searching for long-lost psyche.</p>
<p>  For those looking for a little more backstory, Mighty Baby rose from the ashes of another great overlooked British band, The Action. For a while The Action had been tagged as the band most ready to take over from The Beatles, and unlikely as it seems today, if you listen to The Action&#8217;s early recordings you will wonder why they didn&#8217;t do just that.</p>
<p>  No less than Fab Four producer George Martin thought so as well, as he signed them to their recording contract. Come to think of it, he signed wimp-rock band America too so maybe ol&#8217; Georgy&#8217;s taste is suspect. But that&#8217;s another story. To Martin&#8217;s credit, The Action really did kick some major ass. Mixing equal parts of the Beatles&#8217; (and the other Merseybeat bands) melodic savvy with the pure rock power of the Who and Kinks, The Action were a powerhouse band that nonetheless didn&#8217;t quite get the breaks necessary to really hit it big.</p>
<p>  After a couple of personnel, managerial, label, and even name changes, the remnants of The Action signed with the same management team as Pink Floyd and T-Rex and started experimenting in the studio. Unlike most hard R&#038;B bands who attempted to keep up with the times by embracing the mind-bending sounds of psychedelic rock, the sound seemed natural and not forced and the current line-up seemed adept at playing the new, groundbreaking sub-genre of rock music. </p>
<p>  Christened Mighty Baby by the band&#8217;s new label in an attempt at a new start, the former Action came up with one of the stronger psychedelic albums of the period, an album that stands up with the Beatles&#8217; Sgt. Pepper and the Pretty Things&#8217; S.F. Sorrow as psychedelic rock blueprints. </p>
<p>  Sadly, it went mostly unheard. </p>
<p>  Dropped from their label, the band managed to hook up with Blue Horizon Records for this reissue, their second and final album. Though as good as their first record, at the time it still unfortunately succumbed to the same fate: little airplay and hardly any sales. The times had changed and most succesful bands were either playing soft rock like Crosby, Stills and Nash or a simpler form of boogie/blues-based hard rock like Led Zeppelin which would later sadly evolve into the ear-wrecking sounds of heavy metal. For a band more interested in melody, extended fluid guitar lines and thriling vocal harmonies, the time had definitely passed. But that doesn&#8217;t mean this album isn&#8217;t bliss personified. </p>
<p>  A psychedelic fan&#8217;s dream with exquisite melodic playing and guitar work to make your heart soar to the heavens, this album makes me wish we could return to the &#8217;60&#8217;s for just a little while. Energetic with none of the excessive noodling marring most psyche albums, it&#8217;s a perfect meld of garage and psyche that will stay on your turntable for weeks.</p>
<p>  Fans of psyche will wet their pants over this one. Pick it up, turn on and tune out, babies. Get some of whatever stuff you smoke when your parents aren&#8217;t around and start a-hootin&#8217; because this shit is THE shit. One of the most excellent psyche albums around from one of the most underrated bands ever. Get you some Action and some Mighty Baby as soon as you can. You will not be sorry, and I will guarantee it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several of the inimitably esteemed recording artistes I had the pleasure of becoming <em>Lost In The Grooves</em> with have recently made grand new releases available to discriminating listeners and/or readers out there in what remains of the real world.&nbsp; Yes of course there&rsquo;s head Kink Ray&rsquo;s LONG-awaited so-low album (which sounds not too bad at all to what&rsquo;s left of these ears), but what truly is exciting me this week is <a target="_self" href="https://www.sundazed.com/"><strong>Sundazed&rsquo;s</strong></a> full-color re-release of that last &ldquo;real&rdquo; <a target="_self" href="https://jananddean-janberry.com/"><strong>Jan and Dean</strong></a> long-player, <em>Popsicle</em>.</p>
<p>In truth a hasty grab-bag of hits, misses, and miscellania circa &rsquo;62 thru &rsquo;66 cobbled together to, um, commemorate Captain Jan Berry&rsquo;s recent near-fatal car crash, the <em>Popsicle</em> album actually provides just as wild and crazy a ride as yer typical J&amp;D LP ever would (e.g.: Side Four of <em>The Jan &amp; Dean Anthology Album</em>, anyone?!!) as it veers madly from the ridiculous (&ldquo;One-Piece Topless Bathing Suit,&rdquo; perhaps the funniest Sloan/Barri composition this side of &ldquo;Eve Of Destruction&rdquo;) to the sublime (Jan&rsquo;s tongue-possibly-deep-within-cheek &ldquo;Norwegian Wood&rdquo;) and THEN some (a fully half-an-album&rsquo;s worth of selections with either &ldquo;Summer&rdquo; or &ldquo;Surf&rdquo; in the song-titles themselves: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s My Summer Girl&rdquo; has long been a quite guilty pleasure-o-mine, you know, while J&amp;D&rsquo;s &ldquo;Summer Means Fun&rdquo; more than hangs ten against the Fantastic Baggys&rsquo; near-identical version, I&rsquo;ll have YOU know).</p>
<p>So as Jan lay hovering next to death in nearby UCLA Medical Center, and his until-then hapless cohort Dean &ldquo;The Boy Blunder&rdquo; scoured the vaults to fulfill the duo&rsquo;s contractual commitment to Liberty Records, &ldquo;Popsicle&rdquo; the song &#8212; originally appearing as &ldquo;Popsicle Truck&rdquo; on the November &rsquo;63 <em>Drag City</em> album &#8212; crept to the mid-twenties on the sales charts (I can distinctly remember it jumping from my childhood six-transistors as that fateful Summer of 66 was about to arrive), providing a sticky-sweet if tragically premature capper to the initial career of our most fave pop duo this side of Don &amp; Phil.&nbsp; But <em>Popsicle</em> the ALBUM is in retrospect as fine a place as any to immediately reacquaint oneself with the majesty and true mondo-magic which was, and forever shall be, Jan Berry and Dean O. Torrence &hellip;until Sundazed gets very round to re-issuing their beyond-classic <em>Jan &amp; Dean Meet Batman</em>, that is !!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
