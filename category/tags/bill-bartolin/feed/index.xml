										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blue Ash Special Bonus CD&#8217;s! </p>
<p>There will be a special limited free bonus CD when ordering Blue Ash&#8217;s &#8220;No More, No Less&#8221; from Not Lame or Kool Kat Musik. The Not Lame bonus CD will feature unreleased songs from 1973 that were done &#8220;live&#8221; in Peppermint Studios.</p>
<p>https://www.notlame.com/BLUE_ASH/Page_1/CDBLUEASH1.html</p>
<p>The tracks are:<br />
Hippy, Hippy Shake<br />
(Chan Romero)<br />
Baby You Lied<br />
(Secich- Bartolin)<br />
Now All You&#8217;ve Got Is You<br />
(Kendzor)<br />
She Cried For 15 years<br />
(Secich-Bartolin)<br />
One After 909<br />
(Lennon-McCartney)<br />
I Thought I Knew You<br />
(Secich-Bartolin)<br />
Say Goodbye<br />
(Secich-Bartolin)<br />
Give Me Love<br />
(Secich-Bartolin)<br />
Walls<br />
(Secich-Bartolin)<br />
Paper Bag Blues<br />
(Secich-Bartolin-Kendzor-Evans)<br />
Be My Girl<br />
(Secich-Bartolin)<br />
When I Get You<br />
(Secich-Bartolin)<br />
Make It Easy<br />
(Secich-Bartolin)</p>
<p>The bonus CD album with Kool Kat Musik will feature a &#8220;live&#8221; performance<br />
 of 12 songs recorded  on January 31, 1974 at the Packard Music Hall in Warren, Ohio! The band was  opening for the Raspberries at this show &#8211; and, as you&#8217;ll hear, they definitely had<br />
their &#8220;game face&#8221; on as they rock through these covers and originals:</p>
<p>Hippy Hippy Shake<br />
One After 909<br />
Do You Love Me<br />
Anytime At All<br />
Start All Over Again<br />
Plain To See<br />
What Can I Do For You<br />
She&#8217;s So Nice<br />
Baby Baby Come On<br />
All I Want<br />
Twist and Shout<br />
My Generation</p>
<p>It must be noted that this is an audience recording (the<br />
only type that exists according to the band) that, while not<br />
of the highest audio quality, captures<br />
the band at a magical moment in their career, and serves as<br />
an archival testament to the power they exhibited as a live<br />
band! You&#8217;ll still be awfully<br />
glad you snagged this little piece o&#8217; Power Pop<br />
history!</p>

All of it was written by the&nbsp;Blue Ash songwriting team of Bill &quot;Cupid&quot; Bartolin and Frank Secich. The songs were recorded in Youngstown, Ohio&nbsp;at Peppermint studios between 1972 and 1976. More details will be forthcoming here at &quot;Lost In The Grooves&quot; in the next few weeks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blue Ash is glad and honored to be part of the &quot;Lost In The Grooves&quot; family. This is a brief history of&nbsp;the band. Blue Ash was formed in 1969 by Frank Secich (bass guitar), Jim Kendzor (vocals), Bill &quot;Goog&quot; Yendrek (lead guitar) and David Evans (drums). The band debuted at a psychedelic club called &quot;The Freak Out&quot; in Youngstown, Ohio on October 3, 1969. Determined to go against the then omnipresent long-guitar-solo-jam bands, Blue Ash would forge a style in the manner of their own teen-aged years heroes: Beatles, Who, Kinks, Byrds, Beau Brummels, Hollies, Rolling Stones, Yardbirds, and many others mixed in from the mid-60&#8217;s. Coupled with a wild stage-show and the management of Geoffrey Jones, Blue Ash soon became very popular on the teen-dance and club circuit of PA, NY, Ohio and W.VA. In October of 1970, guitarist Bill Yendrek was replaced by Bill Bartolin. For the next few years Blue Ash played a hectic 200-250 dates a year throughout the region. During that time the songwriting team of Secich-Bartolin were stockpiling an enormous amount of original material.&nbsp;In 1972, they were signed to a recording contract with Mercury Records by the late , great (legendary A&amp;R man/ rock writer)&nbsp;Paul Nelson. Paul also signed&nbsp;&quot; The New York Dolls&quot;&nbsp;around the same time.&nbsp;Their debut lp &quot;No More, No Less&quot; (1973) received rhapsodic reviews in the rock press. Blue Ash along with Big Star and Raspberries became critical darlings of a new sound later to be called &quot;power pop&quot;. With not enough sales or FM airplay came the death knell to the first wave of 70&#8217;s power pop bands. Blue Ash continued on and in 1977 released a 2nd lp on Playboy Records. In 1979 the band broke up. In the ensuing years Blue Ash developed a world-wide cult following with many groups recording their songs: Records, Finkers, Michael Monroe to name a few. Over the years there was rumoured to be tons of unreleased Blue Ash material. In 2004, Not Lame Records released a 2CD set of it with 44 songs called &quot;Around Again&quot;. Blue Ash is now reformed (but not too reformed) and play out occasionally. The band consists of all 4 original members plus 2nd drummer Jeff Rozniata, Bob Darke (bass) and Brian Wingrove (piano, vocals).
