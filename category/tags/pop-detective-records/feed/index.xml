<p>The Deadbeat Poets<br />
Pete Drivere, Terry Hartman, Frank Secich &#038; John Koury</p>
<p>&#8220;NOTES FROM THE UNDERGROUND&#8221;<br />
Now available at http://www.popdetective.com/</p>
<p>The Deadbeat Poets were formed in Youngstown, Ohio in the summer of 2006. The band consists of veteran Ohio musicians with eclectic credentials: Frank Secich (Blue Ash, Club Wow, Stiv Bators Band), Terry Hartman (Backdoor Men, Napoleon In Rags, Terry &#038; The Tornadoes), Pete Drivere (Infidels, Pretty Demons) and John Koury (Infidels, Slackjaw). Their debut album (which was recorded over the first few months of 2007 at Youngstown&#8217;s Ampreon Recorder) will be released on Pop Detective Records in July of 2007 and in late summer in Japan on Vivid Sound Records. Also, making guest appearances on the album are Bill &#8220;Cupid&#8221; Bartolin on guitar and Chris Leonardi on piano and organ. </p>
<p>Soon, you&#8217;ll be able to sit back and relax (pop the top and set the sail) as the Deadbeat Poets take you on a timely journey. To such places&#8230;. romantic places like Beaver Falls (via Mahoningtown) you&#8217;ll go. You&#8217;ll travel to the exotic northside of Youngstown, Cleveland, the depths of the Atlantic Ocean, Toronto, Geneva-On-The-Lake, New York, LA, London, the far reaches of outer space, Paris, Mt. Pilot, The Bering Sea, St. Paul and of course Buffalo, NY. You&#8217;ll meet fun lovin&#8217;, sex-crazed aliens in &#8220;The Truth About Flying Saucers&#8221;. You&#8217;ll hear the tale of the legendary Ray Robinson who once roamed the dark, back-country roads of Western, PA in &#8220;The Green Man&#8221;. You&#8217;ll encounter semi-romantic mountain men and their passions in &#8220;Ernest T&#8221; and ride along with Stiv Bators as he once terrorized the western world in &#8220;The Stiv Bators Ghost Tour&#8221;. You&#8217;ll find out the connection between Ernest Hemmingway and Gertrude Stein and French bidets in &#8220;Where Was I When I Needed Me?&#8221;. You&#8217;ll raise glasses and bottles with the lads in &#8220;No Island Like The Mind, No Ship Like Beer&#8221; and be sadly disappointed by gangsters and thieves as &#8220;The Goody Wagon&#8221; never arrives. If floating in a psychedelic flutter is your inclination then &#8220;What Part Of Cognitive Dissonance Don&#8217;t You Understand?&#8221; will probably be your cup of tea. Then again, you may find that after all of this &#8230;..well that &#8220;It&#8217;s Nothing&#8221; to you. Then again, you may start getting &#8220;A Funny Little Feeling&#8221; that you will enjoy the Deadbeat Poets. </p>
