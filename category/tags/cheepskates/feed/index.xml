										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" width="200" height="300" border="0" src="http://www.purple-cactus.tv/garage-nation/media/knightsoffuzz/Knights300.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a time, </p>
<p>believe you me,<br />long ago and far, far away,<br />when all the best boots were Beatle,<br />trebly white Vox six-strings cooly matched your best gurl&rsquo;s plastic mini,<br />and the words &ldquo;Garage Band&rdquo; had not yet become just another registered Apple trademark.</p>
<p>Well, it isn&rsquo;t only those Hives who care to dwell to this day in such defiantly monophonic, tight-legged times: &nbsp;<br />Coz, believe it or knot, those otherwise empty Eighties and Nineties were positively littered as well with Levi and Rickenbacker-clad mopheads singing and playing up wholly frug-worthy storms for all who would listen </p>
<p>&hellip;whilst, alas, the vast majority of mankind were told to dig Hall and Oates or even <a href="http://img493.imageshack.us/img493/6879/hueylewisthenewssportsfront2ct.jpg" target="_self"><strong>that Fred MacMurray</strong></a> of &ldquo;rock and roll&rdquo; [sic!!] instead, I must most sadly recall.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;d really like to hear <em>and</em> see what all the fuzz SHOULD&rsquo;VE been about back then<br />(not to mention trace the socio-musical routes of either White Stripe straight on down),<br />simply take the next eighty-odd minutes to sit and spin with Purple Cactus/Dionysus&rsquo;<br />utterly woofer-rattling <em>Knights Of Fuzz</em> DVD + ROM.</p>
<p>Yep, it&rsquo;s all here, now, and forevermore: <br />Classic, cutting clips full of wholly-living-colour Cynics, Fuzztones, and tons more Untamed Youth <br />including vintage (1983!) <a href="http://www.earcandymag.com/gpg-remember.htm" target="_self"><strong>Cheepskates</strong></a>,<br />their upstate New York brethren The <a href="http://fufkin.com/columns/gold/gold_12_03.htm" target="_self"><strong>Chesterfield Kings</strong></a><br />(always the out-of-their-headed Stones to the C-skates comparatively tamed Fabulous Four);<br />why, even <em>K of F</em> mastermind Timothy Gassen dons his very own psilocybin-dipped <a href="http://www.geocities.com/theecaveman/marshmallowovercoat/MARSHMALLOWOVERCOAT.htm" target="_self"><strong>Marshmallow Overcoat</strong></a> for not one but &ndash; count &lsquo;em! &#8212; <em>two</em> vibe-riddled vids.</p>
<p>Lo, lest we neither forget Toronto&rsquo;s towering <a href="http://chrwradio.com/lma/1989/What%20Wave%20-%20Mister%20Garager's%20Neighbourhood/The%2010%20Commandments%20-%20New%20Trip.mp3" target="_self"><strong>10 Commandments</strong></a><br />featuring our sweet James Lord on Crampy-indeed lead vox<br />&hellip;..and Speaking of O Canada,<br />Montreal&rsquo;s groovy <a href="http://www.montrealmirror.com/2005/102005/watn22.html" target="_self"><strong>Gruesomes</strong></a> are more than fully represented via their Monkees-on-methamphetamine &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;<br />(very personally speaking, one of my fave pure pop clips OF ALL TIME).</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s <em>still</em> not it !!</p>
<p>Besides all this anarchic archival footage also comes hours more read-only memory content, including 300-plus pages of Tim&rsquo;s criminally out-of-print <em>Knights Of Fuzz</em> encyclopedia-lysergic, twenty-six full &lsquo;n&rsquo; frantic audio clips, and tons upon anti-trendy tons of additional articles, photos, reviews and data galore both old  <em>and </em>retro-new!&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>You can get completely fuzzed up right now if you&rsquo;d like,<br />by dragging it <a href="http://www.myspace.com/knightsoffuzz" target="_self"><strong>into the virtual garage</strong></a> for your fully day-glo all-media preview.</p>
<p>But I heartily recommend taking the whole paisley plunge<br />by grabbing the real thing <br /><a href="http://www.purple-cactus.tv/garage-nation/knightsoffuzz.html" target="_self"><strong>right here</strong></a> <br />right now.</p>
<p>So!<br />Ready?&nbsp; Steady?</p>
<p>Then GO Already !!!</p>
