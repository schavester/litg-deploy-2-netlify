										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is my first LITG Blog, and in fact my first blog at all.  I am happy to be here, and will keep this first one brief.  My most recent discovery of an obscure and great record comes courtesy of The Big Takeover magazine, who did a piece in their last issue on Nick Garrie (Hamilton).  The article had me running to get Garrie&#8217;s late 60s lost masterpiece record, The Nightmate of J.B. Stanislas.  Wow.  Think the soft, orchestrated pop of Bergen White  running into more &#8220;serious&#8221; folk stuff by, say, Nick Drake, then having some encounters with the Baroque pop of The Left Banke, the left of center melodic singer/songwriter sounds of Harry Nilsson and . . . I could go on with the comparisons, but let&#8217;s just say this is a great record that the people of Rev-Ola have put back into the world for us.  If you&#8217;re into sprawling, pyschedelic folk/pop from the late 60s, Nick is your man and this record will hit your sweet spot.  My apologies if anyone on this site has already raved about this record.</p>
<p>Amazon has the record, and if you prefer to buy from your local shop, get them to order it if they don&#8217;t have it on the shelf.</p>
