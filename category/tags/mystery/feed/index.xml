										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In these intimate, revealing solo performances (just Judee with her piano or guitar) recorded over three sessions for a British audience, the mistress of L.A.&#8217;s Rosicrucian folk mysteries shares her exquisite, multi-layered compositions alongside memories of  her musical influences and inspirations, and where the songs fit in her personal cosmography of romantic and spiritual loves. I imagine the disk will appeal to people who are already fans of her debut and &#8220;Heart Food,&#8221; but it&#8217;s strong enough to stand as the introduction it was to UK radio listeners. Sill describes how the Turtles found her living in a car with five other people and gave her a break when they recorded the lovely &#8220;Lady-O,&#8221; then turns in an effortless, stripped down take on that stunner. After hearing Sill talk about the UFO-as-savior symbolism of &#8220;Enchanted Sky Machines,&#8221; the &#8217;50s R&#038;B sources of &#8220;Down Where the Valleys Are Low&#8221; and how &#8220;The Donor&#8221; signifies a plea to god for a break she no longer feels she deserves, those songs will take on new layers of significance. This is a surprisingly warm and funny series of performances for so esoteric a songwriter, and well worth seeking out, though the multiple versions of five songs should be noted. Too, Michael Saltzman&#8217;s tender notes reveal the tragedies of Judee&#8217;s short life, from fears of madness, romantic obsession, drug abuse, injury and the ill-advised crack about David Geffen that scuttled her career, and explore the conflicts that pulled at the artist and finally pulled her down.</p>
