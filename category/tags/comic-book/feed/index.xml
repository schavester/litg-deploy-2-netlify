										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just when you think the universe of J. Ryan, boy sicko, could not get any more deranged and disgusting (yet endearing!), he comes up with a character like Retarded Hitler, whose wee temper problem is offset by his exception anal love skills. What I like best about AYC is the giddy drawing style and the unbridled imagination that feeds the tales, which whip back upon themselves spewing bodily fluids, solids and unidentifiable filth. This second book-length compendium features a range of Loady McGee and Sinus O&#8217;Gynus misadventures, a cameo by Baby Johnson and his, uhm, baby johnson, Boobs Pooter the comic who&#8217;s kind of like Neil-Hamburger-as-serial-killer, the erotic thrill of a man in a shit wig, a selection of color cover and back panels, and dozens of spot cartoons your mom won&#8217;t be cutting out and putting on the fridge. If you&#8217;ve read this far without wincing, you know this is for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">Attention all psychotic teenagers, abusive fathers, and killer clowns:<span>  </span>Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned by a Ã¢â‚¬â„¢72 Datsun. Nothing can stop her. Not even you. The proof is in this comic book. What seems to begin as a predictable Ã¢â‚¬Å“damsel in distressÃ¢â‚¬Â story about a potty-mouthed hottie named Judy Drood looking for a working phone in the abandoned town of ObidiahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Glen, soon turns into a Ã¢â‚¬Å“how toÃ¢â‚¬Â guide for surviving a gangbang in a haunted circus fairground. There is no hero to the rescue there and there doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to be. Fortunately for Judy there is one semi-sane human being in the town, a little girl named Nellie Kelly. They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t become friends, but perhaps the mutual understanding that they both had shitty parents inspires them to want to protect each other in the midst of all the magic bottles, possessed dolls, mad ghosts, stab wounds, split skulls and splattered blood. Is there a moral to the story? DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be mean to girls.</p>
