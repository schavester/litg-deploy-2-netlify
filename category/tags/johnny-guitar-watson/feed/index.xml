										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
     So, just this past Sunday after Thanksgiving, I was running around Charlotte killing time, running errands and checking out the local CD shops along the way and I decided to check out a little shop I usually don&#8217;t go into too often.</p>
<p>     Truth is, I don&#8217;t go into this shop too often because they don&#8217;t really get anything cool too often. It is the weakest location of a local 3 store chain and I go to the other two stores in the chain much more because the locations are better and the results are usually better; in other words, at the other stores I can find stuff I actually want.</p>
<p>     But, I am nearby this bastard third location and I suck it up and decide to go in, totally realizing I probably won&#8217;t find anything worth buying. I search for a little while, thinking I am going to prove myself a visionary by totally striking out so far. I then wander towards the R&#038;B section knowing if I don&#8217;t find anything there, I will be buying nada from this joint. Upon perusal of this section, I notice a little oddity: an album called &#8220;Stoned&#8221; by Lewis Taylor.</p>
<p>     Not recognizing the guy&#8217;s name, I pick it up to check out the liner notes to see if I can recognize some of the players&#8217; and producers&#8217; names. Well, the liner notes are really brief and I only recognize some obscure record industry names in the Thank You&#8217;s but I am intrigued because it seems the guy is a one-man band in that he plays everything himself and produced the CD. </p>
<p>     Well, I love that kind of shit. Good or bad, I am always curious to hear what a person can do with his musical talent when he tries to do it all himself. So, I wander over to the listening station and pop this CD in and I am floored! Soul in the best of the old (Marvin Gaye, Al Green, Prince) and new (D&#8217;Angelo) traditions with plenty of psychedelic rock touches as well to spice it up.</p>
<p>     Needless to say, I am THRILLED with my find and before I listen to too much and ruin it for myself, I take it out of the listening station, rush to the register, pay for the shiny disc and commence to take it home.<br />
     As soon as I get home, I pop that thing in the CD player and start to do some research on the album while Lewis Taylor&#8217;s sweet psychedelic soul music washes over my ears and melts my brain.</p>
<p>     Seems the album came out on the Hacktone label in 2005 and was distributed by Shout! Factory. A check of the Shout! Factory website leads to nothing so I next go to my favorite music research portal, Allmusic.com!</p>
<p>     Soon I learn Lewis Taylor is an English musician who first found some measure of fame  in the mid &#8217;80&#8217;s as a member of the re-united Edgar Broughton Band, playing guitar with the group. After leaving, he started a psychedelic combo called Captain Jack and released two albums with them. He then vanished for almost a decade before landing a deal with Island Records in &#8217;96 on the strength of a demo by Taylor that made the Island suits think they had found the second-coming of Al Green, only with multi-instrumental-playing capabilities. He made two psychedelic neo-soul records for Island and was dropped as both flopped. Seems the suits loved him but didn&#8217;t have the brains to market him correctly. I guess white Englishmen aren&#8217;t allowed to make modern, yet classic-sounding soul records.</p>
<p>     Discouraged, Taylor decided to release albums on his own label and has put out about four or five depending on whether you think homemade CDs given out at gigs count as releases. </p>
<p>     The album I found, Stoned, is actually the second record he released on his own (it came out originally in 2002) but the first record of Taylor&#8217;s to be released in the US. Seems the owners of Hacktone felt the record had sank unjustly and wanted to give it a chance in the States. Sadly, it sank in the States without a trace as well. Seems the album was getting a good push in late 2005 but shortly after Taylor appeared on Conan he developed nodules on his throat and couldn&#8217;t tour the US, so it was Conan and out.</p>
<p>     Now, in late 2006, the label Hacktone is defunct and Taylor is still obscure, the album now languishing in bargain bins everywhere. This is an artist who has been trumpeted by D&#8217;Angelo, Paul Weller, Elton John, Mary J. Blige and a bunch of others but still remains in the shadows.</p>
<p>     If you are into soul, neo-soul, R&#038;B or whatever the fuck they are calling it these days, you need to check this album out. A swirling mass of future funk that channels Johnny Guitar Watson, The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix at the same time and with vocals as sweet as Prince&#8217;s falsetto, Taylor sings some of the most soulful, sensual psychedelic R&#038;B music I have heard in a long time. I can&#8217;t truly label it derivative or new but it does combine both the past, present and future in a way that will make your ass shake, your knees buckle and your heart melt. Most adept at guitar, the man shows a facility for any instrument he touches and shows an affinity for crafting elegant tapestries of music while still finding the funk and psyche-swirling it up.</p>
<p>     Needless to say I am going to spend a lot of time over the next week or so tracking down everything else this guy&#8217;s ever done. To be as old as he is (mid &#8217;40&#8217;s) with over twenty years of music biz experience and have that talent vocally and instrumentally and still be unknown is a fucking injustice. Please search this album out if you can and check it out. I know you won&#8217;t be sorry.</p>
<p>     The Music Nerd knows&#8230;..that Lewis Taylor should be more fucking famous than Justin Timberbitch&#8230;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I saw the recent blog about Johnny Guitar Watson and wanted to add my two cents about this brilliant guitarist by reviewing a different compilation from a year ago. Regardless of when you discover &#8220;Guitar&#8221; &#8211; it will always be a scintillating funktastic experience.</p>
<p>Johnny Guitar Watson &#8211; The Funk Anthology<br />
Shout Factory<br />
   Right off the bat I have to say these are the funkiest two CDs I have heard in a long time. CDs so funky I will put up a dare to you: I will wager my unassailable credentials as a hipper-than-hip music journalist, my various lifetime achievement awards for snarky critique-writing, my curmudgeon&#8217;s license, and my title as Funk Overlord (yes, Funk Overlord &#8211; I won it fair and square from the guys in Black Merda in a card game!) if you can find two CDs funkier then this. Now, James Brown doesn&#8217;t count, but anyone else is fair game.  </p>
<p>   Though Watson originally started his career and gained his first fame as a bluesman, Watson was a master at continually re-inventing himself throughout his career and by the end of his life was known more for being a George Clinton-esque funkmeister than for his blues. He first started in the &#8217;50&#8217;s as a piano player and then switched to guitar, which is where he first began getting noticed. In this way he was a lot like Ike Turner, who also first strarted working as a piano player before picking up the guitar. Like Turner, Watson was an inventive bandleader who came up with many innovative arrangements and skillful gimmicks to set himself apart from the pack. While not pursuing the business angles Turner did to get noticed, Watson was able to market himself as a viable solo artist due to his excellent singing voice, which led to many opportunities never open to Turner. Where Turner had to either find his Tina or record instrumentals, Watson was able to take advantage of many styles, though paradoxically, it took Watson many more years to become a household name than it did Turner. </p>
<p>   He eventually did get his due, though. Starting with his signing to the Dick James Music Group in the early &#8217;70&#8217;s, Watson was set to take his road-tested funk persona to a new level. He had long since went through his early blues phase, a soul phase in the &#8217;60&#8217;s, and several other R&#038;B-based experiments which kept him on the verge of breaking through in a big way but had not quite clicked with the public. Luckily for Watson, he was always ahead of the curve in terms of his ability to judge what would be popular next, what the public was looking for. His problem was he had just not been in the right place or situation to capitalize on it. His extraordinary musicianship kept him in the game as well. Capable of playing many instruments, Watson was always an innovator with sound just as much as with vision. One of the first to experiment with synthesizers, Watson was dreaming up funky applications for them years before most of the artists people readily assume as being the leaders of the new technology. For example, Watson was using the talkbox years before Peter Frampton and funkateer Roger made their names with the device. </p>
<p>   This 2 CD set covers the best of Watson&#8217;s time with the Dick James Music Group and also includes cuts from his last recording, Bow Wow, which was released in 1994. Of course, most of the set leans towards Watson&#8217;s work from the mid-70&#8217;s to about 1982 &#8211; which was the last time he recorded before his comeback Bow Wow so the set pretty much covers his latter and most fertile period right up until his death. There are a healthy four cuts each from the six albums he released &#8211; and one can definitely hear the progression as Watson&#8217;s funk style became more and more assured and confident with each subsequent release. While Bow Wow is nothing more than a desperate, lackluster attept by Watson to show he could still funk with the best of them, the album does have a few moments on it that a Watson fan (or any stone funk fan for that matter) would like and most of those are included on this CD set.</p>
<p>   For those of you who think Sly Stone and George Clinton&#8217;s various projects were the only funky things going on in the &#8217;70&#8217;s, this set is going to shock the hell out of you. Music just can&#8217;t get any funkier than this. Pick this up now!</p>
<p>   So that&#8217;s it. Get you some Johnny Guitar Watson as soon as you can &#8217;cause you don&#8217;t want to live without the funk for very long!</p>
