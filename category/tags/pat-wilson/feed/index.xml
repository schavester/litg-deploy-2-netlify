<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Sometime in early 1984, an obscure Australian singer named Pat Wilson released a new wavish dance song called <strong>Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bop Girl.Ã¢â‚¬Â</strong></font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worry if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never heard it. Few people did. The single never even cracked BillboardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Top 100 in the U.S. It got as high as #104 on the Bubbling Under chart, then dropped off after one week.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ã‚Â </font> </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">That might have been the end of the story, but for one thing. The songÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s video featured a cute, chubby-faced, up-and-coming 16-year-old Australian actress named Nicole Kidman. Thanks to the appearance of the former Mrs. Tom Cruise, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bop GirlÃ¢â‚¬Â has achieved something approaching cult status over the last few years.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ã‚Â </font> </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">And what of the song? ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pretty great confection, actually. Its bump-and-grind, white R&amp;B groove sounds like it might have been cribbed from MadonnaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Material Girl,Ã¢â‚¬Â but that song wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t released until nearly a year later. That makes you wonder if Madonna or then-producer Nile Rodgers had heard Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bop GirlÃ¢â‚¬Â in a club and were trying to cop the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bop.Ã¢â‚¬Â</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ã‚Â </font> </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bop GirlÃ¢â‚¬Â has a lot of other things going for it, though, like an impossibly catchy guitar lick and WilsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unaffected, enthusiastic lead vocal. The surprising appearance of fiddles halfway through even prefigures Shania Twain and Mutt LangeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s genre-mixing experiments of the 1990s. Maybe the biggest compliment you can give this record is that it really does make you wanna bop &#8212; even if you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t dance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ã‚Â </font> </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The song was penned by WilsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s husband, Ross Wilson, who was something of a musical star in Australia at the time, having been in the bands Daddy Cool and Mondo Rock. Of course, you can tell the record is the work of rock veterans who decided to don Ã¢â‚¬Å“hipÃ¢â‚¬Â musical clothes and have a go at the new wave. Still, authenticity hardly matters on the dance floor, to quote the ditzy lyric, this Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bop girlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s A-OK!Ã¢â‚¬Â</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s probably a lot more I could find out about Pat Wilson. But that would probably spoil the mystery and fun of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bop Girl.Ã¢â‚¬Â Sometimes in life itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best not to dig too deep and to just enjoy the superficial surface. Just ask any fan of TomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Nicole.</font></p>
