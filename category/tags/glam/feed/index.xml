I&#39;m predisposed to laud Anton Barbeau for his yeoman&#39;s work luring Scott Miller back to the recording studio (see last year&#39;s swell Loud Family CD, of which we still have a few free copies for Scram <a href="https://www.scrammagazine.com/subscribeus">subscribers</a>), but his lush, Bowiesque art-pop stands on its own freaky merits. Kicking off with the glam starburst of &quot;This Is Why They Call Me Guru 7,&quot; the disc seduces with effortlessly catchy tunes, hyperactive arrangements and a neatly meshed tapestry of electronic and real instruments. The ideas fly furiously, tape runs backwards, cohorts shriek deep in the mix.. and yes, you could say much the same about a Scott Miller record. It&#39;s no coincidence these two have formed a collaboration, and fans of the Loud Family and Game Theory will certainly want to explore Barbeau&#39;s deep catalog of smart, weird pop, with this a timely starting point.</p>
