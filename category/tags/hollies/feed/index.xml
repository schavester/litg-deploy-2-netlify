										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the mid-1960s Graham Gouldman was a one-man Goffin/King or Boyce &#038; Hart. The British musician and songwriter wrote perfect pop songs that were totally of their time, and which were popularized by other, better-known acts.  Gouldman penned the two best songs The Hollies ever recorded (&#8220;Bus Stop&#8221; and &#8220;Look Through Any Window&#8221;) two of the better tracks done by The Yardbirds (&#8220;For Your Love&#8221; and &#8220;Heart Full of Soul&#8221;) and also provided material for Herman&#8217;s Hermits, P.J. Proby, Wayne Fontana . . . </p>
<p>In &#8217;68 Gouldman &#8211; who had previously been part of two different bands, both of them flops &#8211;  decided it was time to put his own versions of some of his songs on record.  John Paul Jones (Francoise Hardy&#8217;s playmate, and later bassist of Led Zeppelin) was brought on board as arranger and co-producer. Some top-of-the-line sessions musicians took up instruments. And Gouldman sat down and cobbled together a workbook of songs that had been hits for other artists, as well as some new and previously unrecorded material.</p>
<p>What came out is a record that should be generally regarded as a Mod-era classic, right alongside The Beatles&#8217; Rubber Soul, The Kinks&#8217; Face to Face, and early recordings by The Who, as well as the afore-mentioned Hollies and Yardbirds. But the album wasn&#8217;t even released in Gouldman&#8217;s native land, and only managed to hit the lower reaches of the Billboard Top 100 in the U.S. </p>
<p>The artist/band Gouldman most sounds like on this record is Emitt Rhodes and The Merry-Go-Round. Gouldman the vocalist has a lisp, and he sings in that almost girlish way that Rhodes does. The arrangements and the production of the material on The G.G. Thing are bubblegumy poppy, a la The Merry-Go-Round &#8211;  that kind of bubblegum where Pure Pop meets Mod Cool.</p>
<p>Gouldman later become a member of The Mindbenders, before the 70s saw him and another Mindbender form 10CC.  Later into the 70s he did the soundtrack to the Farrah Fawcett movie, Sunburn. </p>
<p> In 2004 BMG reissued The Graham Gouldman Thing, and anybody who&#8217;s into 60&#8217;s Mod pop should thank them.  It is one of the best records of its kind. </p>

<p>There&#8217;s no cause to doubt the title and beach party cover art: Rudnick&#8217;s disc is packed with sleepy, summery retro sounds that neatly split the difference between classy &#8217;80s pop (M. Crenshaw, dB&#8217;s, Smithereens) and later, lusher Beach Boys. The tunes, arrangements and boyishly nasal harmonies (partly courtesy the Rubinoos) are tasteful, catchy and only sometimes silly. Bonus tracks include a couple vocals-only takes, and lovingly realized demos of the Beatles&#8217; &#8220;Yes It Is&#8221; and Beach Boys&#8217; &#8220;Til I Die.&#8221; Sweet stuff that power popsters will want to hear.</p>

<em>The Orgone Box</em><br />
(Minus Zero UK, 2001)</p>
<p>Too many bedroom bands drink at the trough of <em>Evolution</em> and <em>Revolver</em>, fire up the old four-track and seek to replicate same, with results typically stiff, unconvincing and a trifle embarrassing. But not this time. Rick Corcoran is the real thing: a massively skilled sixties-influenced songwriter who doesn</p>
