<p>Believe it or not, the very first &quot;real&quot; concert I was ever allowed to attend as a wee Canadian tyke was The Jimi Hendrix Experience at Toronto&#39;s <a href="https://www.canadiandesignresource.ca/officialgallery/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/maple-leaf-gardens-playing-card.jpg"><strong>Maple Leaf Gardens</strong></a>, May 3, 1969. Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨</p>
<p>I&#39;d already been a fervent fan for a couple of years, having spent most of my Grade 8 art class making swirly <a href="https://www.elvis.com.au/presley/jimi_hendrix.shtml"><strong>sketches</strong></a> of Jimi in charcoal. Plus the <em>Are You Experienced? </em>album was right up there Ã¢â‚¬â€œ <a href="https://i118.photobucket.com/albums/o93/Grapost/Jimi1.jpg"><strong>almost</strong></a> Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with <em>Monkees Headquarters</em> on my 1967 Most-Played List.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨</p>
<p>Fast-forwarding, Christmastime &#39;68 was spent, between runs down the local tobogganing hill, digging all eight vinyl sides of The White Album AND <a href="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2589/4090731136_8b649b05ea.jpg"><strong><em>Electric Ladyland</em></strong></a> and, most likely as a direct result, my gym-class rhythm section and I were just starting to assemble our very own semi-power trio when word filtered along the groupvine that the Experience were planning to stop by our very neighborhood in a few months as part of their possibly-Farewell World Tour.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨</p>
<p>In a word then? WOW.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨</p>
<p>My most-trusted pal Ric scored two tickets in the Gardens&#39; nosebleed section and I fibbed to my parents that we were off to a hootenanny (!) for the evening. Yet no sooner had we approached the venue that word began a&#39;buzzin&#39; that our hero had just been <a href="https://thumbs.imagekind.com/member/c537320e-fe74-442d-af91-e83744a6e366/uploadedartwork/650X650/3d186b24-809c-4019-85bb-47194052c036.jpg"><strong>busted</strong></a> for carrying a batch of non- pharmaceutical mood enhancers into Toronto Airport. HmmmÃ¢â‚¬Â¦</p>
<p>Undaunted, we climbed skyward to our seats, sat on sonic needles and pins-ah through both opening acts (the pretty cool <a href="https://www.metacafe.com/watch/yt-LRQRZeUMBd4/cat_mother_good_ol_rock_roll/"><strong>Cat Mother &amp; the All Night Newsboys</strong></a>, whose big hit &quot;Good Old Rock n Roll&quot; my little band was already struggling to learn, followed by none other than, uh, <a href="https://www.wtv-zone.com/ruexperienced/images/Noel_Redding2A.jpg"><strong>Fat Mattress</strong></a>) til the one and only Jimi Himself sauntered on stage, miraculously only a few minutes late.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨</p>
<p>Now considering all the man had already been through that day I guess it was no real surprise the evening&#39;s set consisted of mainly down-cast tunes a la &quot;Red House,&quot; though Jimi <em>did</em> graciously treat the teenage throng with a quick encore full of that fabled, fiery Foxey Purpleness of yore.</p>
<p>And then, suddenly, he was gone. Experience and all.</p>
<p>James Marshall Hendrix returned to town briefly that December however, just long enough to be completely exonerated of all narco-charges (&quot;Canada has just given me <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/the_first_rays/3375929130/"><strong>the greatest Christmas present ever!</strong></a>&quot; he exclaimed to the <em>Toronto Daily Star</em>), but I suppose one could question if, or why, that life lesson ultimately went <a href="https://www.rockmine.com/Hendrix/JimiCert.GIF"><strong>unheeded</strong></a>. And I suppose it does say something that out of all the delicately detailed minutiae forever etched upon my grey matter concerning that momentous concert forty long, long Toronto MayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ago, I can still most vividly recall EXACTLY <a href="https://www.beckersbakeryanddeli.com/images/Cakes/Jimi%20Hendrix.jpg"><strong>what Jimi was wearing</strong></a> (all Harlem-Asbury chic all the way!), what I was wearing even (<a href="https://www.clevelandseniors.com/images/cleveland/pigs/day-glo-pig.jpg"><strong>don&#39;t ask</strong></a>), the appropriately brilliant weather, the commuter train Ric and I snuck on after we told our parental units we&#39;d just be folking around &#8230;hell, I even remember the proto-Bowzer moves Cat Mother &amp; Co. deployed whilst performing their one hit wonder!Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨</p>
<p>But do I recall a single sliver of the sounds and/or <a href="https://www.atr-lang.com/data/media/1/rock&amp;roll_027_hendrix&amp;noel_redding.jpg"><strong>stylings</strong></a> of the Noel Redding-fronted Fat Mattress performance of that same, utterly magical night? No sir, I do not. Which reminds me: Mr. Redding himself <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/noel-redding-730294.html"><strong>passed onward</strong></a> and upward to that great big Gardens in the sky six years ago May 11th.</p>
<p>And the moral, perhaps, to this all? Well, I still find myself revisiting <em>Electric Ladyland</em> on almost as regular a basis as I do the MonkeesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ <em>Headquarters</em>. So you see some things, I guess, <a href="https://www.kruufm.com/files/23/JimiHendrix3.jpg"><strong>shall never change</strong></a>. </p>
