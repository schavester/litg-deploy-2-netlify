<p>Put em all together and they spell EMITT RHODES, a good friend of the Scram gang, and subject of one of our more jaw-droppingly frank interviews. In honor of Emitt, we&#8217;ve created a gallery of rare photos from his personal archives up on flickr, which you may <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/sets/72157594278913892/" target="_blank">peruse at leisure</a>. Many of these only appeared in <a href="https://www.scrammagazine.com/scram18" target="_blank">Scram #18</a>, and others have never been publically seen at all&#8211;including a few from a roll of unprinted slide film circa 1968. Thanks, Emitt, for all the great pix! And if you like deliriously catchy melodic pop, you owe it to your ears to pick up his disks, in thrift stores or import CDs. </p>
