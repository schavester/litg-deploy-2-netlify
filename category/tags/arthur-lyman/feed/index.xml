										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, <a href="https://www.ccmusic.com/search.cfm?searchkey=ARTHUR%20LYMAN&amp;bounce=y&amp;searchType=artist" target="_blank">Collectors Choice</a> releases a series of nine CDs compiling eighteen vintage Arthur Lyman exotica LPs in their bird-calling, fish-scraping, pupu-platter-clattering entirety. The liner notes were written by David Smay and myself (with a bio that appears on each disk, and notes for each release). We had fun debunking some of the mythologies that have long clung to this great exotic bandleader, and placing him in context as the true and eternally creative link between small combo jazz and lush island hotel pop. A couple of my favorite discoveries were the rocking version of &quot;Windmills of Your Mind&quot; from 1969&#39;s <em>Winner&#39;s Circle</em> and a sly bosso nova take on &quot;Hawaiian War Chant&quot; that appeared on the <em>Cottonfields</em> LP, but there&#39;s plenty of great stuff to hear on all of these bargain reissues. We hope they&#39;ll do something to rescue Arthur Lyman&#39;s reputation, which has too long huddled in the shadows of his one-time bandleader Martin Denny. </p>
