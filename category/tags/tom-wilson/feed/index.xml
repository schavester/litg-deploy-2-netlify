<p>Several weeks ago, a random gathering of some of the best musicians from CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest musical berg (thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s <a href="https://www.hamiltonpostcards.com/pages/industry.html"><strong>Hamilton, Ontario</strong></a>, by the way) threw themselves onstage as part of the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s annual Locke Street Festival. Spearheaded by the one and only <a href="https://www.tomwilson.net/"><strong>Tom Wilson</strong></a>, said ad-hoc combo was busy rocking and rolling things all the way up that street as the sun slid down when suddenly, a most familiar figure was spotted nearby. The lead singer of the one, the only, <a href="https://www.teenagehead.ca/"><strong>Teenage Head</strong></a>.</p>
<p>As would later be reported in the press, &quot;I asked Frankie, &#39;Frankie, fuck man, you&#39;ve got to come up here and sing,&#39;&quot; Wilson says. &quot;He said, &#39;You got to give me a hundred bucks.&#39; So I reached into my pocket and I only had fifty, so I asked <a href="https://www.dave-rave.com/"><strong>Dave Rave</strong></a> for the other half. I said, &#39;Dave, fifty bucks for Frankie.&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;And this was the kind of love they had for Frankie. Dave didn&#39;t ask me, &#39;What for? What does Frankie need fifty bucks for?&#39; He was just pulling it out of his pocket. And Frankie got up and did Ã¢â‚¬ËœLet&#39;s ShakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.&quot; </p>
<p>It turned out to be the last-ever public appearance of Frank Kerr, much better known Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and most rightfully so Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as Frankie Venom, who along with his high school pals about thirty-three years ago decided to form a band in between spins of Dolls, Stooges and, yes, FlaminÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Groovies records. Remarkably, that little band that could went on to garner two gold and one platinum twelve-inchers of their very own; in fact, their latest, now available from the fine folk over at <a href="https://www.sonicunyon.com/"><strong>Sonic Unyon Recordings</strong></a>, actually features <a href="https://img32.picoodle.com/img/img32/4/5/29/f_Untitled1m_327f762.jpg"><strong>Marky Ramone</strong></a> on the drums. Terrifically high praise indeed.</p>
<p>In a scar-studded career that admittedly held more bumps than most bandsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Teenage Head never turned (or toned) things down, never towed anyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s line, and never ever made a bad record or gave a bad show that I, or anyone else for that matter, should care to recall. And whether slithering across the heat pipes of TorontoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legendary Crash and Burn club, opening for the Pretenders, Talking Heads and Elvis Costello <a href="https://www.teenagehead.ca/blogs/news/uploaded_images/New-Image-722626.JPG"><strong>in front of fifty-thousand</strong></a> at CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Heatwave festival Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or belting Ã¢â‚¬ËœLetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ShakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ for and with some old friends on Locke Street on a warm late eve Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Frankie Venom was every single inch the Head above all others.  </p>
<p>He succumbed to throat cancer on October 15, 2008, aged fifty-two. Your record collection will never be the same. </p>
