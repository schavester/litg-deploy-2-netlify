<p>Sacramento pop band Knock Knock was recently awarded a SammieÃ‚Â to honor their second CD <em>Girls on the Run </em>(2008), but as superb as that release is, I feel their debut was even more deserving of recognition. <em>Warm Fronts, Cold Shoulders </em>(2004) is comprised of such an abundant range of intriguing textures and indelible melodies that it would inevitably be a tough act to follow. It&#39;s remarkable that punchy uptempo tunesÃ‚Â like &quot;I&#39;ve Been a Drag&quot; and &quot;Dan Can You Stand&quot; can occupy the same space with the languid beauty of &quot;Oceanography&quot; and &quot;Levee,&quot; but Knock Knock seems to have a knack for mixing things up withoutÃ‚Â having to struggle to do so.Ã‚Â &quot;Eye of the Storm&quot; finds a nice balance between the two extremes and is perhaps the best representation of their work as a whole, but you certainly wouldn&#39;t want to miss out on other catchy numbers like &quot;Jorge&quot; and &quot;Rotten Dogs.&quot; Think of a poppier version of Yo La TengoÃ‚Â and you might have an ideaÃ‚Â of what to expect. Frontman Allen Maxwell&#39;s feathery-but-urgent vocals compare favorably to Ira Kaplan&#39;s while Heather Conway adds an even lighter touch to a pair of songs <em>a la</em> Georgia Hubley.Ã‚Â  Tasty stuff indeed, and when you&#39;re finished with this one, you should be more than ready to take in the gorgeous harmonies and sugar-rush momentum of <em>Girls on the Run</em>. </p>
