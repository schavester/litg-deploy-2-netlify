										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jean-Louis Costes is among the most uncompromising musical and performance artists to come out of the &#39;90s DIY scene, as remarkable for his legendarily self-destructive tours with Suckdog as for his surprisingly poignant self-released music. <br />Ã‚Â <br />Costes was featured in the anthology &quot;Lost in the Grooves: Scram&#39;s Capricious Guide to the Music You Missed,&quot; and his 1992 <a href="http://litg.richardschave.com//taxonomy_menu/2/2/242">&quot;End of the Trail&quot; is available for download</a> at lostinthegrooves.com, along with other great, neglected albums. Writer Bengala called EOTT: &quot;an homage to his breakup with indie icon Lisa Suckdog Carver, and a more moving love letter has never been recorded. Splatters of filth and sonic mess hide the sentimentality, but the beauty shines through, triumphantly sad beneath layers of disgust and ugly noise. It is the document of modern humanity as representative of his eraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s id as Gainsbourg was of his. Lauded by the likes of Thurston Moore, Costes remains virtually unknown, even in his own country, a special gem without genre.&quot;<br />Ã‚Â <br />Costes has just begun one of his rare US tours, with a new performance piece called &quot;Les Petits Oiseaux Chient&quot; (&quot;Little Birds Shit&quot;), co-starring Lisou Prout, with support on most dates by Mr Natural. It&#39;s among the most highly-anticipated noise tours of the year. Costes&#39; 2003 presentation of &quot;Holy Virgin Cult&quot; thrilled his long-time fans and earned him a legion of new listeners. After surviving malaria, the Paris riots and the authoring of his first book, this legendary cult figure now plans to survive the USA.<br />Ã‚Â <br />Costes says: &quot;&#39;Little Birds Shit&#39; is the story of an ordinary couple.Ã‚Â  They meet&#8230; they flirt&#8230; they fuck&#8230; They make a baby.Ã‚Â  Gradually they find themselves falling into the trappings of normal existence. Working to make money becomes their new focus. As they grow weary from the struggles of life, they find solace in bizarre acts of S&amp;M sex. Yet cruel, earthly fates conspire to keep them down. The couple must finally come to the logical conclusion of this journey, finishing in Hell.&quot;<br />Ã‚Â <br />Radon presents:<br />COSTES USA Tour 2007: &quot;Les Petits Oiseaux Chient&quot; or &quot;Little Birds Shit&quot; starring: Jean Louis Costes and Lisou Prout with support act: Mr NaturalÃ‚Â  (on most dates)<br />Ã‚Â <br />FEBRUARY<br />Fri 9 : Johnson City, TN @ Heather&#39;s Hideaway<br />Sun 11 Hickory, NCÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  @ Chez Marque w/ Mr Natural<br />Mon l2 Chapel Hill, NC @ Nightlife w/ Mr Natural, Klang Quartet, Jason Crumner<br />Wed l4 Jacksonville, FL @ Yesterday&#39;s Pre-Party International Noise Conference<br />w/ Mr. Natural and 15+ artists from the INC line-up<br />Sat l7 Miami, FL @ Churchill&#39;s Hideaway (International Noise Conference)<br />Mon l9 Tallahasse, FL @ OAF w/ Realicide, Rotten Milk, Mr Natural<br />Tue 20 Atlanta, GAÃ‚Â  @ Eyedrum<br />Fri 23 Houston, TXÃ‚Â  @ Superhappy Funland w/ Mr Natural, Rotten Piece + Richard Ramirez, Concrete Violin<br />Sat 24 Austin, TXÃ‚Â  @ Scoot&#39;s Red Inn<br />Wed 28 Los Angeles @ The Smell w/ Captain Ahab, Mr Natural<br />Ã‚Â <br />MARCH<br />Thu l Oakland, CA @ 21 Grand<br />Sat 3 Portland, OR @ Someday Lounge w/ Mr Natural<br />Sun 4 Seattle, WA @ Rebar w/ Mortii, Mr Natural<br />Wed 7: Rapids City.
