										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img border="0" src="https://duckking1.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/.pond/cover-march.jpg.w180h180.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps it was the most untimely demise of original dreamer <a href="https://dreamers.thefondfarewells.com/img/dreamersband02.gif" target="_self"><strong>Freddie Garrity</strong></a>.&nbsp; But did I really neglect to mention when last we took the <a href="/?p=450" target="_self"><strong>virtual Ferry cross the Mersey</strong></a> that none other than <a href="https://www.frankleesprague.com/" target="_self"><strong>Frank Lee Sprague</strong></a> &ndash; yes, he the still-taller half of those supremely rooty-rockin&rsquo; Sprague Brothers (not to mention an authentic cousin of <a href="https://www.metrobeat.net/binary/3366-317-1/buddy-holly.jpg" target="_self"><strong>The Man Who Invented Sixties Music Himself</strong></a>, I kid you not!!) &#8212; has been very busy indeed &ldquo;on the side,&rdquo; helping keep the meaty, big and bouncy spirit of the M-Beat alive and very thriving here in Century 21?</p>
<p>I hardly would&rsquo;ve believed it possible myself &hellip;UNTIL, that is, I heard for my own a deceptively, disarmingly charmful little disc called <em>Cavern</em>, and on it some of the best, most magnificently melodic p-o-p this side of your fave rave Searchers EP of yore.</p>
<p>And also, here I felt I was the only lad left on the block who thought a certain P. McCartney wrote many of his best songs EVER for&#8230;.. <a href="https://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site295/2006/0421/arts_02.jpg" target="_self"><strong>Peter and Gordon</strong></a>.&nbsp; But Frank Lee too has obviously been listening lots to &ldquo;I Don&rsquo;t Want To See You Again,&rdquo; as well as to some of the more rough &lsquo;n&rsquo; tumblest circa-&rsquo;62 cellar sounds this side of <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/25/BigThreeLive%40CavernClub.jpg/594px-BigThreeLive%40CavernClub.jpg" target="_self"><strong>The Big Three</strong></a>.&nbsp; When not channeling a certain Jane Asher as muse, that is.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Alas, the dank, sweaty, musty, subterraneanly homesick aura of those magic long-gone days and particularly nights beat again right there deep down in Frank Lee Sprague&rsquo;s very own <a href="https://duckking1.tripod.com/id22.html" target="_self"><strong><em>Cavern</em></strong></a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Meet you there soon?&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
