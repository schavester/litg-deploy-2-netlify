<p>Ã¢â‚¬Å“No more Beatles! No more Stones! We just want the Viletones!Ã¢â‚¬Â went the cry of true teen angst Ã¢â‚¬Ëœround my Toronto neighborhood circa the Summer of Hate, 1977. And, memories of my favorite punk-rock combo from <a href="http://www.hamiltonspectator.com/video2/punkbook/"><strong>a misspent youth</strong></a> notwithstanding, I <em>do</em> find myself feeling very much the same these thirty-three-and-a-third revolutions later as <a href="http://musosguide.com/public_html/musos.wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Beatles_Stones.jpg"><strong>big Beatle box sets and Rolling Stone re-issues</strong></a> continue to dominate our collective, sonic rear-view.</p>
<p>Of course I can still thrill to a remastered (<a href="http://www.beatlesagain.com/images/sly_canada.jpg"><strong>mono!</strong></a>) Ã¢â‚¬Å“She Loves YouÃ¢â‚¬Â as much as the next boomer, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rqqaw9iN0Js"><strong>glimpsing Hendrix backstage</strong></a> inside that <em>Get Yer Ya-YaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s</em> anniversary bundle will always raise a grin or two. But surely, <em>surely</em> there must have been <em>something</em> going on during those scant weeks between 1963 and 1969 when Lennon, McCartney, Jagger and/or Richard compositions werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sitting atop the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hit parades.</p>
<p>Surely!</p>
<p>Well, finally, <em>someone</em> Ã¢â‚¬â€œ namely those utterly fab folk over at <a href="http://www.reelinintheyears.com/"><strong>ReelinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ In The Years</strong></a> Ã¢â‚¬â€œ have seen fit to shed light upon some of the <em>other</em> mop-tops whose sounds and styles filled our six-transistors and Sunday evening <a href="http://files.brandflakesforbreakfast.com/uploaded_images/Ed-Sullivan-esquire-798406.jpg"><strong>Ed Sullivan</strong></a> shows. Yes, the first four editions of whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s promised to be an entire <a href="http://www.reelinintheyears.com/images/britishinvasion_3.jpg"><strong><em>British Invasion</em> series</strong></a> of DVDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s are, you bet, here at last, spotlighting Dusty Springfield, HermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hermits, Gerry and the Pacemakers and the Small Faces.</p>
<p>And what audio/visual treats these discs are! Meticulously researched and packaged, expertly restored and annotated and whenever possible hosted by many of the actual participants themselves, the songs and stories flow in never less than quick, LOUD frenzies so perfectly reminiscent of those once-Swinging Sixties themselves.</p>
<p>So, wherever to start then? How about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrIWPjCk8Gw"><strong>Gerry Marsden fondly recalling</strong></a> the very birth of the Liverpool Sound in the kind of detailed Ã¢â‚¬â€œ sometimes most candidly so Ã¢â‚¬â€œ way no <em>Beatles Anthology</em> would ever dare to. Or a self-admittedly Ã¢â‚¬Å“numbÃ¢â‚¬Â <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0_hVwxkSs"><strong>Dusty Springfield </strong></a>deplaning into Australia only to be accused of being Ã¢â‚¬Å“kookyÃ¢â‚¬Â and a spokesperson for Ã¢â‚¬Å“the hippie philosophyÃ¢â‚¬Â? </p>
<p>Elsewhere, not at all coincidentally perhaps, we discover the hitherto-unknown connection between comedian/philosopher Lord BuckleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spiritual Nazz and the Small FacesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ritual Methedrine, plus learn that it was in fact Peter NooneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seemingly innocent rhythm section who schooled <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~steelbeard1/whoholidayinnmoonphoto.jpg"><strong>Keith Moon</strong></a> in the fine art of Holiday Inn Ã¢â‚¬Å“redecoratingÃ¢â‚¬Â: why, watch closely and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll even spot actual Super 8 footage of pool-side, long underwear-festooned Who/Hermits hi-jinks deep within the Bonus Footage!</p>
<p>Such meaty beaty Bacchanalian moments aside however, this is one <em>British Invasion</em> which truly concentrates, as all such documentaries should but seldom do, on the MUSIC. And there are literally <em>hours</em> of vintage performance clips filling these discs, immaculately reproduced and shown complete and uncut, with nary a single word of needless graphic or narration dubbed over the guitar solos for once. Plus, not just the usual stream of oft-recycled <em>Shindig</em> and Sullivan snips either: The producers have obviously gone to incredible lengths to scour the globe in search of seldom, if ever seen footage of, for example, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TJm_Y1Muc"><strong>HermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hermits</strong></a> on Norwegian television or GerryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Pacemakers in LiverpoolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cavern shooting their very own <em>Ferry Cross The Mersey</em> (Ã¢â‚¬Â¦now, when does <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-d0xUXdzoY"><strong>THAT film</strong></a> finally appear on DVD?!!)</p>
<p>Interestingly though, from the wealth of treasures spread across these discs, I was most pleasantly shocked to witness <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9UujJO8Iw"><strong>downright incendiary footage</strong></a> of the Small FacesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Marquee Club debut, March of 1966. While for all the world looking, dressing, and acting like little more than a Cockney Monkees with cooler hair, trapped from the get-go inside these lads was apparently a solid, fighting-tough beat Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ soul combo whose only Caucasian rivals at the time would have been those Young Rascals themselves. Who knew? (and <em>then</em> stay closely tuned for an extensive <em>Colour Me Pop</em> performance of their masterwork <em>OgdenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Nut Gone Flake</em> complete with Ã¢â‚¬Å“HappinessÃ¢â‚¬Â <a href="http://www.knowledgerush.com/wiki_image/a/aa/Unwin-sm.jpg"><strong>Stanley Unwin</strong></a>Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s narration, I kid you not).</p>
<p>Ã¢â‚¬Å“None of us knew how good and how ahead of our time we were,Ã¢â‚¬Â Small Face Kenney Jones admits herein, and that statement could rightfully serve as the modus operandi behind this entire series. Because, you see, <em>The British Invasion</em>, for the very first time ever, delves so very deeply into the hitherto-unexplored Ã¢â‚¬Å“second tierÃ¢â‚¬Â of mid-Sixties U.K. talent, and in doing so paints most vividly an indelible picture of the eraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s myriad musical and social upheavals. And in a way you just wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get from <em>any</em> existing thumbnail study or PBS pledge special, needless to say. </p>
<p><em>Dusty Springfield: Once Upon a Time</em>, <em>HermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hermits: Listen People</em>, <em>Gerry and the Pacemakers: ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gonna Be All Right</em> and <em>Small Faces: All Or Nothing</em> are available separately or, even better, housed together with two and a half full hours of <em>additional</em> Bonus Disc interview and performance footage as a <a href="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R4mWIjyfL.jpg"><strong>five-DVD collectorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s set</strong></a>. Either way you take them, each deserve to be seen and heard repeatedly by any Merseybeating fan <em>or</em> serious student of rock Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll Ã¢â‚¬Â¦or even for someone who just needs to know the correct way to toss a cherry bomb down a Holiday Inn toilet.</p>
<p>ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s <em>all</em> <a href="http://www.reelinintheyears.com/britishinvasion/"><strong>here</strong></a>. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blue Ash is a Lost in the Grooves artist. <a href="http://www.maryattmusic.com/search_results_cd.php?cd=MMG+292&#038;artist=206" target="_blank">Click</a> to sample the music or purchase tracks from <em>Around Again &#8211; A Collection of Rarities From the Vault 1972-1979</em>. And keep an eye peeled to Frank Secich&#8217;s <a href="https://www.lostinthegrooves.com/?p=979" target="_self">Blue Ash blog</a> here at LITG for news, photos and insights straight from the band. This reissue (of a double CD first put out by the good folks at Not Lame) is just the start, as we&#8217;ll soon be digging deeper into the Blue Ash vaults for songs never before heard by fans.</p>
<p>Metal Mike Saunders provided this vintage record review for the <em>Lost in the Grooves</em> anthology:</p>
<blockquote><p>Blue Ash <em>No More, No Less</em> (Mercury, 1973)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I Remember A Time&rdquo; could do for Blue Ash what &ldquo;Mr. Tambourine Man&rdquo; did for the Byrds: the start of a brilliant career, a Number One hit, instant mythology. The guitar intro lasts all of five seconds before Jimmy Kendzor and Frank Secich&#8217;s voices come in, oozing of everything the Byrds and Lovin&#8217; Spoonful ever promised, the soaring harmonies in the chorus driving over jangling lead guitar work. It&#8217;s the sound of tomorrow right here today, it&#8217;s the perfect folk-rock single. It&#8217;s beautiful, that&#8217;s what.</p>
<p>This is one of the most spirited, powerful debuts ever from an American group. <em>No More, No Less</em> opens with &ldquo;Have you Seen Her,&rdquo; a fast rocker kicked off by four whomps on David Evans&#8217; snare. This is the one that makes me think of The Who; the lead guitar is pure West Coast, though.</p>
<p>&quot;Just Another Game&rdquo; is the one quiet song, an effective tonedown before &ldquo;I Remember A Time.&rdquo; &ldquo;Plain To See&rdquo; is similar to &ldquo;I Remember A Time&rdquo; in the way its simple, compelling melody rocks out with vocal harmonies framed over a trebly Byrds guitar sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here We Go Again&rdquo; follows, midway between the hardest and softest numbers on the first side. What&#8217;s great here are the group vocals on top of the tuff folk-rock cum hard rock instrumental sound; it&#8217;s like killing two birds with one stone, the whole premise behind the old and new Mod groups (Small Faces, early Who, the Sweet), not to mention the hard pop masterpiece known to the world as &ldquo;Do Ya.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time this album ends, there&#8217;s no doubt about it, Blue Ash have got themselves one hell of a debut LP that may send fellow stateside groups like Stories, the Raspberries, and Big Star running back to the woodshed to come up with music even better than their present stuff. (Mike Saunders)</p></blockquote>
