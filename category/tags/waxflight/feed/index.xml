										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, yeah&#8230; I have been absent for a very long time and I want to apologize. Not that folks have been wearing out the &quot;refresh&quot; buttons waiting for a new &quot;A Beautiful, Ugly Noise&quot; entry to show up, but none-the-less, I feel like the kid who hasn&#8217;t been coming to practice and can&#8217;t figure out why he is always sitting on the bench during all the games. I promise to do better, coach. </p>
<p>Where have I been? Well here, there, ultimately nowhere. I will shamelessly plug <A HREF="https://www.myspace.com/waxflight">Waxflight</A>, an albums-worth of songs I have recorded with lots of help from musician friends who are much more talented than myself and who I love dearly. I hope to have it all cleaned up and shiny by the time the Mayan Calendar cycles us out of existence, so I have a good 6 years left, right? Anyways, stop by the take a listen and be my friend.</p>
<p>Last Sunday I went to La Fonda on Wilshire Blvd for the first time since I moved to LA in 1997. Good Lord that was some slammin&#8217; Mariachi. I want to go back when the <A HREF="https://www.mariachidivas.com/html_version/about_us.html">Mariachi Divas</A> are playing. How in the world could you possibly go wrong with an all female Mariachi Band?</p>
<p>Well, I am back, this is a promise. It&#8217;s been so long this is almost like another introduction. I have lots of records that I want to write about and those will be coming up soon, soon, soon.</p>
<p>Put me back in the game, coach.</p>
<p>-Craig</p>
