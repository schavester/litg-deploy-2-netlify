										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img border="0" src="https://duckking1.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/.pond/cover-march.jpg.w180h180.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps it was the most untimely demise of original dreamer <a href="https://dreamers.thefondfarewells.com/img/dreamersband02.gif" target="_self"><strong>Freddie Garrity</strong></a>.&nbsp; But did I really neglect to mention when last we took the <a href="/?p=450" target="_self"><strong>virtual Ferry cross the Mersey</strong></a> that none other than <a href="https://www.frankleesprague.com/" target="_self"><strong>Frank Lee Sprague</strong></a> &ndash; yes, he the still-taller half of those supremely rooty-rockin&rsquo; Sprague Brothers (not to mention an authentic cousin of <a href="https://www.metrobeat.net/binary/3366-317-1/buddy-holly.jpg" target="_self"><strong>The Man Who Invented Sixties Music Himself</strong></a>, I kid you not!!) &#8212; has been very busy indeed &ldquo;on the side,&rdquo; helping keep the meaty, big and bouncy spirit of the M-Beat alive and very thriving here in Century 21?</p>
<p>I hardly would&rsquo;ve believed it possible myself &hellip;UNTIL, that is, I heard for my own a deceptively, disarmingly charmful little disc called <em>Cavern</em>, and on it some of the best, most magnificently melodic p-o-p this side of your fave rave Searchers EP of yore.</p>
<p>And also, here I felt I was the only lad left on the block who thought a certain P. McCartney wrote many of his best songs EVER for&#8230;.. <a href="https://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site295/2006/0421/arts_02.jpg" target="_self"><strong>Peter and Gordon</strong></a>.&nbsp; But Frank Lee too has obviously been listening lots to &ldquo;I Don&rsquo;t Want To See You Again,&rdquo; as well as to some of the more rough &lsquo;n&rsquo; tumblest circa-&rsquo;62 cellar sounds this side of <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/25/BigThreeLive%40CavernClub.jpg/594px-BigThreeLive%40CavernClub.jpg" target="_self"><strong>The Big Three</strong></a>.&nbsp; When not channeling a certain Jane Asher as muse, that is.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Alas, the dank, sweaty, musty, subterraneanly homesick aura of those magic long-gone days and particularly nights beat again right there deep down in Frank Lee Sprague&rsquo;s very own <a href="https://duckking1.tripod.com/id22.html" target="_self"><strong><em>Cavern</em></strong></a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Meet you there soon?&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" width="160" height="160" border="0" src="https://www.fufkin.com/merseybeat.gif" />&nbsp; For those of us born right around the time Elvis kinda invented rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll, but <em>especially</em> for any VH1-educated readers out there who actually believe The Beatles truly were, are, and 4-everafter shall be the B-all and end-all of it all, socio-musically Sixties-speaking that is:</p>
<p>The current <em>Fufkin</em> dot com contains a big piece-o-Piggery regarding three (yes, <em>count &lsquo;em !!</em>) grand new discs from The Viper Label which more than answer the following musical questions &hellip;and THEN some:</p>
<p>* What did Gerry and the Pacemakers sound like <em>long</em> before they ever hooked up with Big George Martin or even Joe Meek?</p>
<p>* Which semi-skiffle combo out of the very northern U.K. recorded Johnny Cash songs &ndash; possibly inventing cow-punk and/or alt. C&amp;W in the process &#8212;&nbsp; <em>decades</em> before Rank and File actually did either??</p>
<p>* Did those B-52&rsquo;s, masquerading beneath the nom-de-group The Four Just Men, <em>really</em> first record &ldquo;Rock Lobster&rdquo; circa 1964???</p>
<p>* and, lastly but far from leastly, did the one and only Kirkbys <em>really </em>usher in that Merseybeat-snuffing Summer of &lsquo;67 as The 23rd Turnoff &#8212; singing the until-now seldom-heard-indeed &ldquo;Flowers Are Flowering&rdquo; &#8212; only to surface yet again as (&hellip;wait for it&hellip;) proto-proggers Wimple Winch ??!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The answers, my friend, are flowing cross the Mersey,</p>
<p>but you gotta <a target="_self" href="https://www.fufkin.com/columns/gold/gold_03_04_06.htm"><strong>click right here</strong></a> to get gear, luv&hellip;..</p>

<p>Too many bedroom bands drink at the trough of <em>Evolution</em> and <em>Revolver</em>, fire up the old four-track and seek to replicate same, with results typically stiff, unconvincing and a trifle embarrassing.

<p>Sex Clark 5 <em>Strum &amp; Drum!</em>  (Records to Russia, 1987/ Beehive Rebellion, 1996)  </p>
<p>Hailing from Huntsville, AlabamaÃ¢â‚¬â€the place where Wernher von Braun traded rocketry know-how for immunity, but perhaps more significantly birthplace of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Eight Miles HighÃ¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â‚¬â€these lo-fi pop wunderkinder had one of the eightiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ great lost discs in Strum &amp; Drum! Their name is one of the broad strokes forming a sly humored sensibility, this from a group also given to titling a noisy piss-take Ã¢â‚¬Å“Get Back Yoko,Ã¢â‚¬Â and producing an electronic loop of the phrase Ã¢â‚¬Å“Girls of Somalia,Ã¢â‚¬Â apparently a 5th dimensional play on the Beach BoysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ celebrations of regional pulchritude. But these are the oddities on a disc thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 95% ebullient, near-perfect Beatlesque pop, delivered with careless glee all but unheard of in the power pop ghetto. None of singer/guitarist James ButlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s twenty songs clocks in above 2:43, giving them the opportunity to charm without boring. SC5 leaves you wanting more, but with the next unforgettable melody never far away. Take Ã¢â‚¬Å“Detention Girls,Ã¢â‚¬Â a reductive micro opera with a cheerleaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chant giving the if-you-blinked-you-missed-it bridge that extra jolt sending the whole marvelous package into sugary hyperdrive. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Modern FixÃ¢â‚¬Â is at once daffy and poignant. The powerfully delivered line Ã¢â‚¬Å“Why donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t we take all our gimmicks, put Ã¢â‚¬Ëœem all in one box/ And trade Ã¢â‚¬Ëœem for a bag of tube socks?Ã¢â‚¬Â seems (and is) absurd on its face, but in context itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the possibly final plea of a lover trying to make a rough love work. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ValerieÃ¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s singsong melody seems somehow backwards, an exquisite medieval meander fused with a sweetness straight out of the McCartney songbook. Lightning-paced Ã¢â‚¬Å“AlaiÃ¢â‚¬Â is blessed with one of those hooks that wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quit, though what the Ã¢â‚¬Å“alai-lai-lai-laiÃ¢â‚¬Â the band is on about may never be revealed. Sometimes bassist Joy Johnson sings in the sweet, slightly flat voice of a serious little kid, but mostly Butler leads the show, mouth racing to keep up with the shambling, ecstatic rush of his band. These dizzy, precise little tunes are like musical meringues, each one a brilliant gem of an idea whipped to soft, gooey peaks. Look for the out-of-print 1996 CD reissue that includes the magical early Ã¢â‚¬Å“Neita Grew Up Last NightÃ¢â‚¬Â EP. (Kim Cooper, from the book<em> Lost in the Grooves</em>) </p>
