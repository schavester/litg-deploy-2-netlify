										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" width="160" height="125" border="0" src="http://img303.imageshack.us/img303/4443/zerxgeetr4yr.gif" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve just received my latest Care Package from ol&rsquo; pal <a target="_self" href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/10183928"><strong>Mark Weber</strong></a>, via the Zerx Records &amp; Press faux-conglomerate deep down there in the 87108 zip code. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, wittily stuffed inside his very latest chapbook split alongside jazz poet Gerald Locklin were the latest two installments of Mark&rsquo;s greatest of so many inventions:&nbsp; Volumes 21 and 22 of the rightfully Zerx-famous <em>albuZERXque</em> compact compilations. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The ear truly boggles &hellip;particularly at the abundant sharp Dylan retreads spread across Number 22. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Some people call these things <em>samplers</em> akin to them embroidery and needlework delicacies those dear 19th Century maidens stitched together,&rdquo; Mark writes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just like that.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet they, like all 50-and-counting Zerx CD&rsquo;s, are in fact limited editions of usually a hundred or so, each of which come in hand-printed linocut cardboard sleeves, &ldquo;rather than computer-generated jewel case art.&rdquo;&nbsp; It goes without saying, though I will anyways, that all us happily Lost in the Grooves can greatly appreciate this endearingly analog approach to the graphic end of business, no?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, whilst not trawling NM as if on behalf of some bizarro world Smithsonian Institute, and/or heading up his very own self-styled &ldquo;prettified country band&rdquo; <a target="_self" href="http://queenellen.com/bubbadinos/"><strong>The Bubbadinos</strong></a> (&ldquo;Tenuousness, trepidation, drought, locust, musica antigua, cant &amp; want, pock-marked chrome, lapsed backyard hallucinations, clippity-clop cowboys &amp; indians, flat tires, cloven-hoofed, low odds, dice, subdural hematoma, jailhouse coffee, bellybutton lint&rdquo; is how their most-aptly-titled <em>The Band Only A Mother Could Love</em> album has actually been described, I kid you knot), Mark can as well be seen curating his esteemed collection of modern age <a target="_self" href="http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt967nd16q&#038;chunk.id=dsc-1.2.9"><strong>jazz photos</strong></a> over there at UCLA, can quite simultaneously be heard hosting <a target="_self" href="http://zerxpress.blogspot.com/2005/06/radioshow.html"><strong><em>Weber&rsquo;s Weekly Worldwide Radioshow</em></strong></a> straight outta KUNM 89.9 Albuquerque, and somehow <em>still</em> finds some time to tell us all about it at the inimitable <a target="_self" href="http://zerxpress.blogspot.com/2005/06/zerxcatalog-albuzerxque.html"><strong>ZerxPressBlogSpot</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Head straight there immediately, won&rsquo;t you all, to sample for yourselves some of the many munificent Zerx Leisure Products:&nbsp; &ldquo;Roots Music from the Deep Southwest of the Mind,&rdquo; &ldquo;Home of The Bubbadinos and other world / class musicians and poets who happen to live in New Mexico or would like to or visited some time or &lsquo;nuther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over 50 Records and Still Going Wrong !&rdquo;</p>
