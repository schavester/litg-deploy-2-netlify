<p>Ã‚Â Daisy Spot has been one of Sacramento&#39;s most interesting and exciting bands for the past fifteen years now even though they&#39;ve released only one CD to date. Fortunately, their self-titled debut album was well worth the 13-year wait. Co-lead singers Mike Farrell and Tatiana Latour manage to maintain a sensuous vibe throughout as they seductively croon in unison on most of the tracks. Despite the consistent tone, the band touches on a variety of styles, including bossa nova, country, rock, and soul. The album won a SAMMIE (Sacramento Area Music Award) in 2006 for &quot;Best Local CD,&quot; although I believe it could&#39;ve been in contention for the best among any released nationally that year had it reached more ears. Tatiana also won for &quot;Best Female Vocalist,&quot; and she could&#39;ve easily earned it just for her breathtakingly-beautiful performance on &quot;All I Wanna Know.&quot; Although the CD&#39;s an instant classic, it doesn&#39;t quite prepare the uninitiated for just how exhilarating their live shows can be. Bassist Brian Latour and drummer Alex Jenkins always provide reliable and steady support, but the adrenaline really kicks in whenever guitarist Farrell launches into one of his incendiary solos while Tatiana dances languidly as though in a trance. I remember being mesmerized by this pair of former lovers the first time I saw them perform in a club, and they continue to work their magic together many years after introducing themselves as a rock &#39;n&#39; roll couple. </p>
