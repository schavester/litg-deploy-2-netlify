<p>I have been make illustrations for the next issue of Cinema Sewer (www.cinemasewer.com). These illos are for an article on movies that have had their so-called strong dialogue edited for televison by being dubbed differently in strange ways. As research I have been revisiting movies like Blue Velvet (still great), Ghostbusters (yes, Dan Aykroyd was funny once!), Pulp Fiction (yawn), and Scarface (still great). The Scarface had alot of great bonuses including a short that highlighted the edited and altered for TV version (&#8220;Where&#8217;d you get that scar? Eating pineapple?&#8221;). Another short was on Scarface&#8217;s influence on hip hop. It was utterly pointless and ridiculous having to hear all these rappers hype up Scarface, the obviously unlikeable character who&#8217;s, er, actually quite a bad man. Yet still they give him props for coming from humble beginnings, having bling, blah blah blah. An idiotic rapper actually named himself Scarface! I&#8217;d really like to do a short feature like that one but have it be hip hop tipping its&#8217; hat to &#8220;Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer&#8221; including having a rapper named Henry talk about how the character influenced him. &#8220;He came from such humble beginnings.&#8221; &#8220;He never took no for an answer.&#8221;</p>
