										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>RARE LIVE 17 Pygmies SHOWÃ‚Â  with Sean McCue (Summercamp) and Cellist Michelle Beauchesne<br />SOhO Restaurant &amp; Music Club<br />1221 State Street Suite 205<br />Santa Barbara, CA 93101 <br />(805) 962-7776<br />Sunday September 30, 7:30 p.m.<br />17 Pygmies will be performing songs from their new release due out October 31, 2007<br /><a href="https://www.myspace.com/17Pygmies" target="_blank">https://www.myspace.com/17Pygmies</a></p>
<p>Approximately eight months from their last release (Groundhog Day to Halloween to be exact) The 17th Pygmy has indeed released <em>Ballade of TristramÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Last Harping</em> their second full length CD in less than one year (somewhat different than the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s previous 17 year hiatus between releases, eh?) Formerly and perhaps to be known again someday (you never know) as 17 Pygmies, the seventeenth pygmy (Jaxon Del Rey) decided that The 17th Pygmy (are you still following?) was a name that better reflected the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60s Psychedelic -70Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Classic Rock direction of the new recordings. Think The 17thÃ‚Â  Floor Elevator or perhaps The Exploding Plastic Inevitable Pygmy.<br />Ã‚Â <br />Consisting of original 17 Pygmies and Savage Republic member Jaxon Del Rey, Jeff Brenneman (formerly of White Glove Test) on Guitars, returning classical Guitarist and now vocalist Meg Maryatt, former Swivelneck and White Glove Test member Tony Davis on Bass, and Drummer Dirk Doucette from you guessed itÃ¢â‚¬Â¦White Glove Test, The 17th Pygmy have combined their unique talents to create a musical tribute to the style and inventiveness of some of their favorite music, namely Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60s Psychedelia and Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ70s Classic Rock.</p>
