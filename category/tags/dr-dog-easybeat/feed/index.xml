<p>I love to check out bands on Myspace. That&#8217;s how I find music these days. It&#8217;s a perfectly egalitarian system. You get a few pictures &#038; four songs, whether you&#8217;re Sting or The Hangnails. During one of my semi-inebriated late-night trowels I stumbled onto Dr. Dog. What I heard really intrigued me, so I bought their cd, Easybeat. While waiting for it to arrive I read some reviews that mentioned their overt Beatle-ness. A few really slagged them for it, like saying, &#8216;We&#8217;re so over this, dude&#8217;. Well it arrived today and I&#8217;m on listen number six. I suppose it can be called Beatle-esque in that it has harmony, melody, &#038; unexpected juxtapositions of musical elements (i.e. string quartets giving way to garage-band breaks, sing-alongs that pop out of nowhere, feedback over augmented chords). There is nothing here that is ripped from the fabs, save for one tossed-off Obladi-ish bass line on the opening number. Mostly what is Beatle-esque is an obvious striving to make something that&#8217;s going to stick around. Not to say it&#8217;s pretentious or precious in any way, it&#8217;s just that it&#8217;s obvious these guys are shooting for something. There is intent here that goes beyond writing a good or even catchy song. And like the Beatles, it walks the line between melancholia and jubilation, often in the same song. Mostly, it sounds like a band in a room dicking around and having a lot of fun. Sonically, It has the weird lo-fi weirdness of the Basement Tapes. No high end at all, which is kinda neat. Gives the ears an unexpected rest. It was recorded on a 1/4&#8243; 8-track, probably the same Fostex I have in my closet. It&#8217;s a magical little machine that may have contributed to the discs hazy mood. There are correlations between Easybeat &#038; the two Simon Dawes EP&#8217;s, which have a similar fly-by-the-seat sound of the Kinks recording in a tool shed. Like the Dawes records, vocals distort, people go off microphone, and ragged harmonies are left in with the spot-on ones. Such a simple act, and one that could be interpreted as a careless one, but the bravery of leaving the grit in results in a sound that&#8217;s soothingly human, a sound you can snuggle up to. Couple that with the great songs these guys write, and you got something that&#8217;s essential. I hope no one gives them a budget for the next record, either.</p>
