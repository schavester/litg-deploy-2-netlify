										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Active from 1964-1967, this North English combo deserve more than its &#8221; Lemmy Kilmeister&#8217;s first band&#8221; footnote. With their taut 40-minute sets and clerical airs, they were favorites of the Northern dance club scene, though the lack of original material limited their options. A late move to London to record for Shel Talmy didn&#8217;t change the world, though theirs&#8217; surely turned more moddish and they found hipper writers to cover. The band&#8217;s appealing confidence shows in the title track, a startling rearrangement of the Who&#8217;s then-unreleased &#8220;The Kids Are Alright&#8221; replete with tinkling keys and falsetto call-and-response vocals, and on the irresistibly twitchy &#8220;Say Mama.&#8221; Stay tuned till the closer, &#8220;Little Rosy,&#8221; an unreleased Ray Davies tune performed with properly Kinksy abandon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the mid-1960s Graham Gouldman was a one-man Goffin/King or Boyce &#038; Hart. The British musician and songwriter wrote perfect pop songs that were totally of their time, and which were popularized by other, better-known acts.  Gouldman penned the two best songs The Hollies ever recorded (&#8220;Bus Stop&#8221; and &#8220;Look Through Any Window&#8221;) two of the better tracks done by The Yardbirds (&#8220;For Your Love&#8221; and &#8220;Heart Full of Soul&#8221;) and also provided material for Herman&#8217;s Hermits, P.J. Proby, Wayne Fontana . . . </p>
<p>In &#8217;68 Gouldman &#8211; who had previously been part of two different bands, both of them flops &#8211;  decided it was time to put his own versions of some of his songs on record.  John Paul Jones (Francoise Hardy&#8217;s playmate, and later bassist of Led Zeppelin) was brought on board as arranger and co-producer. Some top-of-the-line sessions musicians took up instruments. And Gouldman sat down and cobbled together a workbook of songs that had been hits for other artists, as well as some new and previously unrecorded material.</p>
<p>What came out is a record that should be generally regarded as a Mod-era classic, right alongside The Beatles&#8217; Rubber Soul, The Kinks&#8217; Face to Face, and early recordings by The Who, as well as the afore-mentioned Hollies and Yardbirds. But the album wasn&#8217;t even released in Gouldman&#8217;s native land, and only managed to hit the lower reaches of the Billboard Top 100 in the U.S. </p>
<p>The artist/band Gouldman most sounds like on this record is Emitt Rhodes and The Merry-Go-Round. Gouldman the vocalist has a lisp, and he sings in that almost girlish way that Rhodes does. The arrangements and the production of the material on The G.G. Thing are bubblegumy poppy, a la The Merry-Go-Round &#8211;  that kind of bubblegum where Pure Pop meets Mod Cool.</p>
<p>Gouldman later become a member of The Mindbenders, before the 70s saw him and another Mindbender form 10CC.  Later into the 70s he did the soundtrack to the Farrah Fawcett movie, Sunburn. </p>
<p> In 2004 BMG reissued The Graham Gouldman Thing, and anybody who&#8217;s into 60&#8217;s Mod pop should thank them.  It is one of the best records of its kind. </p>
