										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ladies and gentleman,<br />
We have started uploading vids from our massive<br />
archive dating back 13 years!<br />
July Fourth Toilet is a musically performative project<br />
I&#8217;ve been heavily involved in as a founding member<br />
where our mandate is to always have a differently<br />
themed show!<br />
Lots of info in the sidebar of the links provided.<br />
And here with recordings:<br />

album that is one third hard driving basement boogie,<br />
one third faux Eastern but 10000 miles up experimental<br />
instros, one third wonky ballads, one percent je ne<br />
sais quoi, and zero bullshit.<br />
Sample clips:<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>And to what pleasure do we owe this 25 cent treasure found all seven inches of in a Powell Street furniture store, hmm? With its&#8217; aquamarine logo that relays label name Psi Records, a trident jutting out betwixt the two words. The label address is 1747 W. 3rd Ave., Vancouver, B.C. The printed phone number of 732-3761, when called, knew no knowledge of this record, catalog number 101. Year unknown. The group was The Outraged Husbands. The song &#8220;Zeus Creation&#8221; is the sounds of a group of men boisterously chanting along with marching band style orchestration, &#8220;We are the men of the nation, we like the ladies in their place, so we say down with the women&#8217;s liberation and up with Zeus Creation! We like the girls who wear bikinis, cool chicks are never ever cold&#8230;&#8221;<br />
What follows next is an endless litany of household chore commands and how, after all that, the women must &#8220;look like a doll&#8221; when they get home. The song signs off with, &#8220;Men! Wonderful men! Sensational men!&#8221; And applause. It all clocks in at one minute and fifty four seconds. Flip the record over and it&#8217;s the exact same thing. Was this song a tongue-in-cheek response to Women&#8217;s Lib or was it a satire on the misogynist response to Women&#8217;s Lib? This record seems too out and out ridiculous to be made as a fear based reaction to equality. Still, who or what was this mysterious Zeus Creation?<br />
One large question remains: who made this record?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ai to the yai yai, it&#8217;s my first Blog posting! Will it get me work? Is it supposed to be informal? My foot&#8217;s asleep so that&#8217;s an affirmative  sign in regards to my last question.<br />
I reside in Vancouver, BC and often get asked to contribute to a free music rag here called The Nerve, especially lately as  they know that I am currently spending my time waiting between employment insurance cheques. The music editor is an exceedingly charming British ex-pat of exceptional taste, which  makes it rather difficult to say &#8220;No&#8221; even when it means &#8220;No.&#8221; What follows are two reviews that I recently wrote for this publication. The first review of the Queen DVD is self-explanatory (except to say that White Rock is an all too  real suburb located just outside Vancouver where Paul Rodgers really does live). The second is a fake review of a non-existent band. In a way this band, Sourkraut Sunset,  does exist as they are a glib pastiche of what is currently &#8220;hot&#8221; in the International Critics&#8217; Corner regarding the Vancouver music scene. Discussion to follow.</p>
