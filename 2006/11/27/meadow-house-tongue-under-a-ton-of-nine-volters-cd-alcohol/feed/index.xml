					<description><![CDATA[i&#039;m actually very disappointed with meadow house&#039;s album - wayyy too poppy!  i&#039;d hoped that it would be a showcase of his homemade harry partch-style instruments implemented in a bitter anti-music a la epistaxis time (his most recent work, and i enjoy this much more than the hellebore stuff which was five years ago).  but it&#039;s a joke.
i think dan doesn&#039;t like people who do drugs and get intoxicated, in fact, i believe he wants to kill them... he is very educated apparently- if epistaxis is to be taken at face value!
i am always stalking this elusive character to discover more about this erratic enterprise...]]></description>
