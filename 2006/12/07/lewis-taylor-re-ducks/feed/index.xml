					<description><![CDATA[So you have it from a reliable source that Lewis Taylor does in fact have new music in the works?  I saw an announcement on the HackTone Records MySpace page that Lewis had retired from the music business and that The Lost Album was going to be a post-career release here in the U.S.  That announcement about his retirement was about two months ago.  Have things changed since then?  I&#039;m going to be optimistic and hope that your sources are reliable, since I love this man&#039;s music.  The world isn&#039;t the same without Lewis&#039; music.]]></description>
