					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s good to see Gouldman be recognized for something other that 10cc and &#034;I&#039;m Not in Love.&#034;&#160; His three hits for Herman&#039;s Hermits -- &#034;East West,&#034; &#034;No Milk Today&#034; and &#034;Listen People,&#034; are probably the most soulful and meaningful recordings the band ever did.&#160; His way with a mini-story is equalled by his melodic inventiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I interviewed Johnny Ramone for my college newspaper in 1985, when The Ramones were on their &#034;Too Tough to Die&#034; tour.&#160; When I asked him about Gouldman (who had produced a previous Ramones LP), it sent him into a semi-comic tirade against how 10cc was wimpy&#160;and &#034;I&#039;m Not in Love&#034; was terrible.&#160; I don&#039;t think he meant to be mean, but it did show me this is the way a lot of people view Gouldman. I wish I had saved the interview tape.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

Hey Tony-

Well, I can&#039;t say I&#039;m surprised to hear that Johnny Ramone wasn&#039;t a 10cc fan. But you&#039;re right, Gouldman is a great story-teller and tune-writer.  I love his own version of &quot;No Milk Today&quot; on The Graham Gould Thing. And &quot;Bus Stop&quot; - well, I&#039;ve always thought that was just about the most perfect pop song ever.  The opening track on the record, &quot;The Impossible Years,&quot; is another stunning gem of melody and storyline. Having said all of that, it would be fun to listen to Johnny ragging on &quot;I&#039;m Not in Love.&quot;
