					<description><![CDATA[I just read a glowing review about this songwriter Fernando Viciconte in the new Magnet, so I downloaded his new album Enter to Exit from itunes,and let me tell you....It&#039;s amazing! If you are a fan of beatles, Harry Nilsson, Posies, etc.. you would love this album. Has anyone heard of this guy before? I&#039;ve been a fan of pop music for years and I never had until three days ago. Per the review this is his fifth album, so I am stunned that I am not familiar with his music. I think he is from Portland, Oregon or L.A., does anyone know if he is touring? ]]></description>
