I have a few questions regarding some very rare songs from a few movies
 and I&#039;m hoping that someone can help me out.   :-)

 The songs that I&#039;m looking for are extremely rare they are:



 1.  Don&#039;t Tell Her It&#039;s Me - Michael Ruff  (&quot;Don&#039;t Tell Her It&#039;s Me&quot;)


 Many of these artists are obscure or singers that I&#039;ve never heard of
 before but I love their music.)


 2 . This boy&#039;s on a roll - Robert Gordan (From the movie &quot;Oxford Blues&quot;
 starring Rob Lowe.)




 3.  Stowaway - Mark Ryder (Also from &quot;Oxford Blues&quot;)




 4.  Rock and roll days/nights - Jim Wootten (From the made for T.V.
 movie &quot;Can You Feel Me Dancing&quot; starring Justine Bateman)


 5.  Smooth Mover - Diana Dewitt And Michael Hannah (Also from &quot;Can You
 Feel Me Dancing&quot;)



 6.  Let&#039;s Keep What We&#039;ve Got - Marilyn Mccoo (&quot;The Parent Trap II&quot;)



 7.  Songs from the movie &quot;Double Switch&quot;


 8. Dare to win - SILVIE

 * If anyone can get these songs onto mp3 and send them to my e-mail or
 put them onto a cd I&#039;d be most appreciative as I&#039;m so desperate I&#039;ve
 been trying to find these songs for so long now. Or even if someone out
 there has the recording equipment to record these songs from the movie
 or something that would really mean so much to me.

 I&#039;m a major 80s fan which you would&#039;ve picked up going by my list as
 all of these movies/songs are from the 80s so any 80s fans out there
 that can help me send me an e-mail when you can.

 Kindest Regards,

 Ellie from Australia. :-)
